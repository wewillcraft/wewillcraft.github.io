## New Look. Same Mission.

Hey there! We're **Will Craft Software**: a collective of crafters who love what
we do.

We build software that matters and help the next generation find their way in
tech, all while keeping faith, fellowship, and craft at the heart of everything.

## God at the Center

Here's the thing: everything we do flows from our faith. We believe our coding
skills are gifts from God, meant to be used well and shared generously. Our code
is our craft, but our craft is our worship.

We don't separate Sunday from Monday, you know? Whether we're debugging code at
2 AM or helping a student through their first project, we see it all as
meaningful work. Every bug fixed, every feature shipped, every "aha" moment with
a mentee... these are all chances to reflect God's creativity, excellence, and
love.

And look, we're not perfect. Far from it! But we approach our work with
humility, knowing that our real purpose isn't just to build great software
(though we absolutely try for that). It's to love God and love people through
the gifts He's given us.

We welcome friends from all backgrounds and beliefs. While faith is our
foundation, respect and love are what we practice every day.

## Our Logo, Our Story

<img src="/favicon.svg" alt="Will Craft Software Logo" style="max-width: 200px; height: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;">

This logo tells our whole story:

- **The Cube**: Each side represents the care we put into our work, built piece
  by piece with purpose
- **The Upward Arrows**: A reminder that everything we build points to something
  greater
- **The Light From Above**: It's not our light, but His, that makes the work
  shine
- **The Angle Brackets**: Software is our canvas. Code is our craft.
- **The "W" Formed By Walls Of "U"**: You make up Will Craft Software. This is
  about community.
- **The Negative Space**: The gaps remind us we're not done growing yet

It's not just a logo. It's who we are.

## Why We're Here

Simply put:

We're here to build with meaning.

To craft with purpose.

To raise up others.

And to leave the web better than we found it.

## What We Actually Do

### Build Software That Matters

We partner with organizations doing real good in the world. Churches,
nonprofits, community groups... folks who are out there making a difference. We
build the tech that helps them reach further and do more. Every project is
another way to light up the darkness a little bit.

### Train the Next Generation

Through our 100-Day Journey program, we walk alongside aspiring developers as
they figure out not just how to code, but who they are and what they're called
to build. It's not school (no offense to schools!). It's more like
apprenticeship, where you learn by doing alongside people who've been there.

Students don't just gain coding skills. They find their confidence, discover
their calling, and join a community that'll support them long after the program
ends.

### Connect the Community

We bring together student clubs, tech groups, nonprofits, and anyone who wants
to build with purpose. Through meetups, talks, and shared projects, we create a
network where everyone can learn from each other. It's more than networking
(though that happens too). It's genuine fellowship with people who get it.

### Share What We Know

Some tools are too good to keep to ourselves. Our open-source projects are our
way of giving back to the global community. We solve problems that ministries
and nonprofits face every day, then share the solutions so nobody has to start
from scratch. Consider it our gift to the community.

## Our Values (The Real Ones)

### Build With Purpose

Every line of code should count for something. We create tools that empower
people, systems that lift others up, and software that serves real needs.
Technology should make the world better, not just different.

### Pass It Forward

We don't gatekeep knowledge. When we learn something, we teach it. When we build
something useful, we share it. Like an old craftsman teaching an apprentice, we
pass on not just skills but the heart behind the work. It's slower than just
doing it ourselves, sure. But it's how good things last.

### Aim Higher

We're not in this for the GitHub stars or the LinkedIn likes. We build for
causes that matter, for people we may never meet, for impact that outlasts our
commits. If our work helps someone else succeed, even if nobody knows we did it?
That's a win.

### Keep Learning

Every bug is a teacher. Every teammate has something to share. Every project is
a chance to grow. We're not trying to be perfect (good luck with that!). We're
just trying to be better than we were yesterday.

### Share the Wealth

Knowledge, tools, lessons learned... when we have something good, we share it.
That's how a community grows stronger. What helps one person can help many. Even
small contributions can become part of something huge.

### Carry Each Other

This isn't a solo game. We help each other through tough sprints, celebrate wins
together, and make sure nobody gets left behind. Sometimes that's code review.
Sometimes it's just listening when someone's having a rough day. We're stronger
together.

### Always Be Creating

We build because we can't not build. Whether it's fixing a tiny bug or launching
a major feature, we're always making something. Not because we have to, but
because creating is part of who we are. And you never know which small project
might change everything.

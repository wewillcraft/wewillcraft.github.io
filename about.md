## New Look. Bigger Mission.

Hey there! We're **We Will Craft**: a global movement of young changemakers
transforming the world through technology.

Because impossible dreams need builders, we're equipping young people everywhere to
solve hard problems, lead movements, and transform their communities. All while
keeping faith, fellowship, and craft at the heart of everything.

## God at the Center

Here's the thing: everything we do flows from our faith. We believe our coding
skills are gifts from God, meant to be used well and shared generously. Our code
is our craft, but our craft is our worship.

We don't separate Sunday from Monday, you know? Whether we're debugging code at
2 AM or helping a student through their first project, we see it all as
meaningful work. Every bug fixed, every feature shipped, every "aha" moment with
a mentee... these are all chances to reflect God's creativity, excellence, and
love.

And look, we're not perfect. Far from it! But we approach our work with
humility, knowing that our real purpose isn't just to build great software
(though we absolutely try for that). It's to love God and love people through
the gifts He's given us.

We welcome friends from all backgrounds and beliefs. While faith is our
foundation, respect and love are what we practice every day.

## Our Logo, Our Story

<img src="/favicon.svg" alt="We Will Craft Logo" style="max-width: 200px; height: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;">

This logo tells our whole story:

- **The Cube**: Each side represents the care we put into our work, built piece
  by piece with purpose
- **The Upward Arrows**: A reminder that everything we build points to something
  greater
- **The Light From Above**: It's not our light, but His, that makes the work
  shine
- **The Angle Brackets**: Software is our canvas. Code is our craft.
- **The "W" Formed By Walls Of "U"**: You make up We Will Craft. This is about
  community.
- **The Negative Space**: The gaps remind us we're not done growing yet

It's not just a logo. It's who we are.

## Why We're Here

Simply put:

We're here to build with meaning.

To craft with purpose.

To raise up others.

And to leave the web better than we found it.

## The Movement We're Building

### Activate Every Young Person

We're awakening youth to their world-changing potential. Through massive activation
campaigns, free workshops, and purpose-discovery challenges, we reach thousands.
We show young people, especially in developing nations, that poverty isn't destiny,
that their ideas matter, and that technology is their tool for transformation.
No more hopelessness. Just activated youth ready to build solutions with their own hands.

### Equip for Impact

We provide the complete toolkit for youth-led transformation. Open-source frameworks
for running clubs, step-by-step guides for launching movements, technical training
that actually matters, and leadership development that shapes character. Every
resource is free, shareable, and designed to multiply. Whether it's young people
in Manila starting their first tech club or a team in Kenya building apps for local
NGOs, we make sure they have everything they need to succeed.

### Connect the Changemakers

We're connecting the dots between youth with skills and communities with needs,
between young leaders and experienced mentors, between local clubs and global
movements. Our directory links every youth organization, every willing mentor,
every NGO needing help. We facilitate partnerships that change trajectories. This
is bigger than networking; it's building the nervous system of a global movement.

### Multiply the Movement

True movements multiply themselves. We train young people not just to succeed but
to replicate success, showing them how to start new clubs, mentor new leaders, and
spread the movement to new territories. Our leadership accelerator creates trainers
who create trainers. We're building a self-sustaining, ever-growing movement that
will reach every school, every young person, every nation.

## Our Values: CRAFTER

### Create With Purpose

We build what matters. Tools that empower, systems that uplift, code that serves
people not just products. We believe technology should advance the greater good,
serving missions that matter and people who make a difference. Every build begins
with purpose and ends with impact. If it doesn't serve humanity, we don't build it.

### Reach the Unreached

We find the hidden talent in unexpected places. The kid in the province with no
internet. The young woman told tech isn't for her. The student who thinks
change-makers look nothing like them. We go where others don't, teach who others
won't, and prove that builders come from everywhere. Every untapped potential is
a future legend waiting.

### Always Be Crafting

We were made to make, even when no one's watching. Whether in small bugfixes or
massive projects, we stay curious, learning, building, experimenting. We don't
wait for the perfect moment or ideal conditions. We build because it's woven into
who we are. Every small act of creation carries the potential to serve, shape,
and spark something greater.

### Forge Connections

Build bridges between youth and mentors, clubs and communities, problems and
solvers. We're the glue that connects organizations across schools, cities, and
countries. Every connection multiplies possibility. Where computer science students
meet healthcare NGOs, innovation happens. The network effect is our superpower.

### Tend the Flame

We keep the fire burning bright by constantly feeding it. Every person we teach
adds fuel. Every skill we share makes it stronger. We're not passing off
responsibility; we're multiplying the light. Like keepers of an eternal flame,
we ensure it never dies, only grows. When you teach one, they teach ten. This is
how movements spread.

### Evolve Constantly

Never settle. What worked yesterday might not work tomorrow. We adapt, experiment,
iterate. Every failure teaches, every success gets improved. We're not building a
monument; we're growing a living movement that evolves with the needs it serves.
Stay curious, stay humble, stay hungry.

### Reinforce Each Other

Your strength covers my weakness. My experience guides your growth. We're not just
a team; we're an ecosystem where everyone's success feeds everyone else's. Code
reviews, pair programming, midnight debugging sessions. We show up for each other
because that's how excellence happens. When one struggles, we all lean in. When
one succeeds, we all celebrate.

# About Will Craft Software

## New Look. Same Mission.

We are **Will Craft Software**: a collective of crafters.

We build purposeful software and mentor the next generation, guided by faith, fellowship, and craft.

## Our Logo, Our Creed

<img src="/favicon.svg" alt="Will Craft Software Logo" style="max-width: 200px; height: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;">

This logo holds more than design. It holds meaning:

- **The Cube**: Each facet a reflection of our care, built block by block with purpose.
- **The Upward Arrows**: A reminder that everything we build points to God.
- **The Light From Above**: It is not our light, but His, that makes the work shine.
- **The Angle Brackets**: Software is still our canvas. The code, our craft.
- **The "W" Formed By Walls Of "U"**: You make up Will Craft Software. Community is our foundation.
- **The Negative Space**: The gaps remind us: we're not done. There's space yet for growth.

This isn't just branding. It's a visual creed.

## Our Purpose

We're here to build with meaning.

To craft with calling.

To raise up others.

And to leave the web better than we found it.

## What We Do

### Build Purposeful Software

We create digital solutions that matter: software that serves real needs, built with excellence and intention. Every line of code is crafted with care, every feature designed with purpose.

### Mentor the Next Generation

Through our 14-week Journey program, we guide students and early-career professionals through personal growth, technical excellence, and spiritual formation. We believe in raising up the next generation of purposeful technologists.

### Foster Community

We're not just developers. We're a fellowship. We believe that the best software comes from diverse teams united by shared values and mutual support.

## Our Values

### Faith

Our work is an act of worship. We believe that excellence in our craft honors God and serves others.

### Fellowship

No one codes alone. We build together, learn together, and grow together. Community is our superpower.

### Craft

We're committed to mastery. Not perfection, but the continuous pursuit of excellence in everything we create.

## Join the Journey

- A **mentee** looking to grow in your craft and calling

## New Look. Same Mission.

We are **Will Craft Software**: a collective of crafters.

We build purposeful software and mentor the next generation, guided by faith,
fellowship, and craft.

## God at the Center

Everything we do flows from our faith. We believe that our abilities are gifts
from God, meant to be stewarded well and used to serve others. Our code is our
craft, but our craft is our worship.

We don't separate the sacred from the secular. Whether we're debugging code at
2 AM or mentoring a student through their first project, we see it all as holy
work. Every bug fixed, every feature shipped, every "aha" moment with a mentee -
these are all opportunities to reflect God's creativity, excellence, and love.

This doesn't mean we're perfect. Far from it. But it means we approach our work
with humility, knowing that our ultimate purpose isn't to build great software
(though we strive for that), but to love God and love people through the gifts
He's given us.

We welcome collaborators from all backgrounds and beliefs, united by a shared
commitment to excellence and service. While faith is our foundation, respect and
love are our practice.

## Our Logo, Our Creed

<img src="/favicon.svg" alt="Will Craft Software Logo" style="max-width: 200px; height: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;">

This logo holds more than design. It holds meaning:

- **The Cube**: Each facet a reflection of our care, built block by block with
  purpose.
- **The Upward Arrows**: A reminder that everything we build points to God.
- **The Light From Above**: It is not our light, but His, that makes the work
  shine.
- **The Angle Brackets**: Software is still our canvas. The code, our craft.
- **The "W" Formed By Walls Of "U"**: You make up Will Craft Software. Community
  is our foundation.
- **The Negative Space**: The gaps remind us: we're not done. There's space yet
  for growth.

This isn't just branding. It's a visual creed.

## Our Purpose

We're here to build with meaning.

To craft with calling.

To raise up others.

And to leave the web better than we found it.

## The Values of the Guild

### Forge With Purpose

We create what counts—tools that empower, systems that uplift, and code that
supports people, not just products. We build with the belief that technology
should advance the greater good—serving missions that matter and people who make
a difference. In the guild, every build begins with purpose and ends with
impact.

### Pass the Flame

We don't just teach—we entrust. To shape the future, we walk with those who will
one day lead it, sharing not only our skills, but our passion, our convictions,
and the reason we build. Like a blacksmith passing down the forge, we hand off
more than tools—we hand off the will to carry the craft forward. This isn't fast
work. It's faithful work. And it's how the flame endures—burning brighter in
those who come next.

### Aim Higher Than Ourselves

In the guild, we build for something greater—for missions that matter, for
people we may never meet, for outcomes that outlast our names. Success isn't
measured by recognition, but by the impact left behind. Whether our work is
praised or unseen, we craft with the conviction that the highest aim is to lift
others higher. If our part fades from the credits, but someone else stands
taller because of it—that's the win.

### Level Up Continuously

Every line of code, challenge, or teammate teaches us something—if we're willing
to learn. In the guild, we press on—not to be perfect, but to be better than
yesterday. Learning is a lifelong quest, and we level up with every step. We
honor the process, knowing that who we're becoming matters as much as what we
build.

### Share the Bounty

Not all treasure is meant to be kept. Whether it's hard-won knowledge, helpful
tools, or lessons from the last quest—we give what we've gained. In the guild,
generosity isn't optional; it's how we multiply impact. What blesses one can
bless many. What we give may seem small, but in the right hands, it becomes part
of something far bigger than us.

### Carry Each Other

This isn't a solo campaign. We watch each other's backs, patch wounds, and match
pace with those who need it. In the guild, we carry burdens like gear—shared
across the party, so no one falls alone. Sometimes that means offering advice;
other times, it means just sitting with someone in the hard parts. Strength
isn't just in what you can lift, but in what you're willing to carry for someone
else.

### Always Be Crafting

We were made to make—even when no one's watching. Whether in small bugfixes or
large quests, we stay curious, learning, building, experimenting. We don't wait
for the perfect moment or ideal conditions. We build because it's woven into who
we are—and because every small act of creation carries the potential to serve,
shape, and spark something greater.

## What We Do

### Purpose-Built Software

We partner with organizations on the frontlines of change—those who serve,
uplift, and fight for what matters. Through handcrafted websites and apps, we
build tech that carries their mission further. Every project is a torch lit, a
signal fire in the dark.

### Forge Future Disciples

We train the next generation of digital artisans through mentorship rooted in
faith, purpose, and code. This isn't school—it's a journey walked side by side
with experienced developers who pass on both their skills and their values.
Through our 14-week Journey program, apprentices don't just gain experience—they
gain belonging, confidence, and calling.

### The Network of Crafters

We connect student orgs, tech clubs, nonprofits, and mission-driven makers into
one living network—a guild without walls. Through talks, meetups, and shared
quests, we pass along what we've learned and listen deeply to each other's
stories. This is more than networking—it's fellowship with purpose.

### The Open Vault

Some tools are meant to be shared. Our open-source projects are gifts to the
global community—crafted to solve common problems faced by ministries,
non-profits, and grassroots movements. We maintain a codex of solutions for
others to freely build upon. What we've learned, we leave behind as blessing.

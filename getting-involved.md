## Join the Guild

There's no single path into Will Craft Software. Some arrive as apprentices
seeking to learn. Others come as masters ready to teach. Many discover they're
both. Wherever you are in your journey, if you're drawn to purposeful craft and
meaningful impact, you belong here.

## For Mentees: Begin Your Journey

### The 100-Day Journey Program

Our flagship mentorship program isn't just about learning to code. It's about
discovering who you are, what you're called to build, and how to craft with
purpose. Through personal growth, technical excellence, and optional spiritual
formation, you'll emerge not just as a better developer, but as a more
intentional human.

**What you'll gain:**

- Real-world project experience with nonprofits
- One-on-one mentorship from experienced developers
- A supportive cohort of fellow journeyers
- Practical skills in modern web development
- Personal growth and leadership development
- A clearer sense of purpose and calling

**Requirements:**

- Commit 10-15 hours per week for 100 days (14 weeks)
- Open mindset and willingness to learn
- Basic computer literacy (no coding experience required)
- Heart for service and making a difference
- Reliable internet connection

### Dealing with Impostor Syndrome

**Listen closely:** If you're reading this and thinking "I'm not qualified,"
"I'm not smart enough," or "This is for other people, not me" - we need to talk.

Impostor syndrome hits everyone. That senior developer you admire? They googled
basic syntax yesterday. That confident speaker at the conference? They threw up
before going on stage. That "naturally gifted" programmer? They failed their
first three coding interviews.

Here's what we know to be true:

- **You don't need to be an expert to start.** Every master was once a disaster.
- **Your unique perspective is valuable.** Your background, struggles, and
  viewpoint bring something others don't have.
- **Feeling scared means you care.** Fear is just excitement wearing a disguise.
- **Everyone is making it up as they go.** Seriously. Everyone.
- **Your questions help others.** That "dumb" question you're afraid to ask?
  Three other people are wondering the same thing.

If you're from an underrepresented background, if you're self-taught, if you're
switching careers, if you failed before, if you're the first in your family to
pursue tech - **you especially belong here**. The guild needs your voice, your
perspective, your questions, and your journey.

Don't self-reject. Let us decide if you're ready. Apply, and let's find out
together.

## For Mentors: Pass the Flame

### Share Your Craft

You don't need to be a "senior" developer to mentor. If you're one step ahead,
you can guide someone who's one step behind. Sometimes the best teacher is the
one who just learned the lesson yesterday - it's still fresh, still real, still
relevant.

**What we ask of mentors:**

- 2-3 hours per week commitment
- Patient heart and encouraging spirit
- Willingness to share both successes and failures
- Basic proficiency in web development
- Desire to invest in someone's growth

**What you'll receive:**

- Training in effective mentorship
- Community of fellow mentors
- Opportunity to solidify your own knowledge
- The joy of watching someone level up
- Leadership development experience
- Eternal impact on someone's journey

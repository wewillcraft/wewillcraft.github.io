Every day, brilliant minds give up on their dreams because no one showed them
how.<br> Every day, communities suffer from problems their own youth could
solve.<br> Every day, we lose another changemaker to hopelessness.

_We're done watching dreams die._

We believe impossible dreams need builders.<br> And we are those builders.

We believe talent hides in unexpected places.<br> That one activated person
activates ten more.<br> That righteous anger flows from radical love.<br> That
small faithful steps lead to giant leaps.

We believe God gave us this fire not to warm ourselves,<br> But to light paths
for those stumbling in darkness.

We build because suffering demands response.<br> We lead because someone has to
go first.<br> We teach because lifting others lifts everyone.

The harvest is plentiful.<br> The workers are few.<br> We were born for such a
time as this.

We see a world where every young person knows their purpose.<br> Where solutions
come from lived experience.<br> Where impossible dreams get built every single
day.

This world doesn't exist yet.<br> But we're building it.<br> Starting with you.

We are Crafters.<br> We build impossible dreams.

**Will you build with us?**

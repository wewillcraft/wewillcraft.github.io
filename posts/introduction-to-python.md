## Overview

As you researched about what will be the first language you will use in the future, you might have saw `Python` as one of the language options. You've gotten curious, and here you are finding the answers to your why's and how's. In this post, I will explain to you why Python is one of the best beginner programming languages to learn.

## What is Python?

`Python` is a high-level programming language that is used in a variety of applications including Data Science, Web Development, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Software Engineering, and even Game Development.

The language removes details of computer hardware, making `Python` more human-readable and easier to write compared to low-level languages. But this doesn't mean that the language is perfect, every programming languages has it's pros and cons.

## Why choose Python as the first language?

Unlike low-level languages like `C/C++`, `Assembly` or `Rust` (When used for system-level programming), they can be pretty overwhelming for beginners since they are directly communicating to the hardware of your system unit. On the other hand, `Python` is very straightforward that avoids problems that you can have in low-level languages like Memory Management as the **Interpreter** (the program that runs your code/file) automatically does all the heavy-tasks by itself.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros:
1. **Easy-to-Read Code**: As I've been mentioning before, `Python` is as easy as learning the English language when starting out. 
    It's clear, clean and easy to understand for beginners.

2. **Tons of Help and Resources**: With how much tutorials and guides out there in the internet, you can write your own `Python` code in just a few minutes!

3. **Not Worrying About Memory**: Now the word **Memory** seems scary at first glance, but it's basically non-existent if you are just doing simple programs using `Python` as a beginner. The **Interpreter** will handle of the heavy tasks just for you!

4. **Building Stuff Fast!**: Since `Python` is much more simpler compared to low-level languages, you don't need to stress yourself about the details on most syntax used as you can make ideas into a simple program super fast.

### Cons:
1. **Not Super Fast**: Even if I said that you can make programs super fast, `Python` is not the fastest language. The **Interpreter** does the heavy work for you, hence you wait for it to finish.

2. **Making Mobile Apps**: Now I am rushing a bit here, but it is good to know that `Python` isn't fit to be used for Mobile Applications as languages like Java, Swift or Kotlin are better.

3. **Making Video Games**: If you have the passion to learn **Game Development**, unfortunately `Python` isn't fit for making games. `Python` can only be used to make simple games like Pong, Tic-Tac-Toe or a simple Platformer Game.

4. **Uses More Memory**: Because the **Interpreter** handle things for you, in exchange the hardware gives it more memory just to load your program assuming you've made a very complex system or program.

## Tools to Use Python as a Beginner

- **An IDE or Integrated Development Environment**: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- **Python's Interpreter**: [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

**NOTE**: If you are going to use `PyCharm` as your IDE, there is a guide on how to download `Python's` Interpreter, else download it separately using the link. 

## Conclusion

This post is only for those who like to start using `Python` as their first programming language. Hopefully this post gave you the motivation to use `Python` outside of the **Cons** mentioned before. Do not worry about the technical jargons used and enjoy!

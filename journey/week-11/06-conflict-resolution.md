# Conflict Resolution

**Time:** 45 minutes  
**Purpose:** Develop skills to navigate, mediate, and resolve conflicts constructively for stronger relationships and better outcomes

## Reframing Conflict

Conflict isn't the problem—avoiding or mishandling it is. When managed well, conflict can drive innovation, strengthen relationships, and improve decision-making. The goal isn't to eliminate conflict but to make it productive.

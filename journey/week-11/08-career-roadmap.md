## Stop Planning Your Whole Life

Five-year plans are fantasy. The job you'll have in 5 years might not exist yet.
The skills you'll need are still being invented.

But 90 days? That's real. That's actionable. That's enough time to make real
progress without the pressure of predicting your entire future.

In this lesson we're creating a roadmap that actually works: focused, flexible,
and forgiving.

## First, Celebrate How Far You've Come

Before we plan ahead, let's acknowledge your journey:

### Your Wins (Yes, You Have Them)

Think back one year. What couldn't you do then that you can do now?

**Skills I've gained:**

---

---

---

**Challenges I've overcome:**

---

---

---

**People I've helped:**

---

---

---

**Things I'm proud of (even small ones):**

---

---

---

See? You're not starting from zero. You're building on a foundation.

## The 90-Day Sprint Framework

Why 90 days works:

- Long enough to achieve something meaningful
- Short enough to stay focused
- Flexible enough to adjust as you learn
- Concrete enough to measure progress

### Your Next 90 Days

**Start date:** ___________ **End date:** ___________

**One Big Goal:** What's the ONE thing that would make the biggest difference?

---

**Three Supporting Goals:** What else would move you forward?

---

---

---

That's it. Four things. Not forty.

## Breaking It Down

## The Weekly Rhythm

**Monday:** Plan the week (30 minutes)

- What are this week's priorities?
- What could block progress?
- Who do I need to connect with?

**Wednesday:** Mid-week check (15 minutes)

- Am I on track?
- What needs adjusting?
- Quick wins I can grab?

**Friday:** Week wrap-up (30 minutes)

- What got done?
- What didn't and why?
- What's the priority for next week?

Put these in your calendar now. Non-negotiable.

## Try This Now (10 minutes)

**The 90-Day Declaration**

Fill this out and share it with someone:

"In the next 90 days, I will ___________ [specific goal].

I'll know I succeeded when ___________ [concrete outcome].

The first step I'll take this week is ___________ [specific action].

I'm sharing this with ___________ [person's name] for accountability."

Send this to them. Right now. Before you overthink it.

## Your Support System

You don't do this alone. Who's on your team?

### The Career Board of Directors

**The Mentor:** Someone who's where you want to be

- Who: ___________
- How they help: ___________

**The Peer:** Someone on a similar journey

- Who: ___________
- How they help: ___________

**The Cheerleader:** Someone who believes in you

- Who: ___________
- How they help: ___________

**The Truth-Teller:** Someone who'll be honest

- Who: ___________
- How they help: ___________

Reach out to one of them in this lesson.

## Tracking Without Obsessing

### The Simple Scorecard

Rate yourself weekly (1-5):

**Progress:** Am I moving forward? Week 1: ___ Week 2: ___ Week 3: ___ Week 4:

---

**Energy:** Am I sustainably engaged? Week 1: ___ Week 2: ___ Week 3: ___ Week
4: ___

**Learning:** Am I growing? Week 1: ___ Week 2: ___ Week 3: ___ Week 4: ___

If any score drops below 3 for two weeks, something needs to change.

### The Celebration List

**Small wins to celebrate:**

- First application sent
- New skill practiced
- Difficult conversation had
- Project completed
- Connection made
- Lesson learned
- Week without giving up

**How I'll celebrate:**

## When Things Don't Go As Planned

They won't. Here's what to do:

### The Pivot Protocol

**Week 2-3 Check:** Minor adjustments only **Week 6 Check:** Consider bigger
changes **Week 9 Check:** Salvage what you can, learn what you must

### Common 90-Day Obstacles

**"I don't have time"**

- Cut the goal in half
- Find 15 minutes daily
- Something beats nothing

**"I'm not seeing progress"**

- Progress isn't always visible immediately
- Track effort, not just outcomes
- Ask someone else if they see changes

**"I want to quit"**

- Normal at days 20-30 and 60-70
- Push through for one more week
- Then reassess

**"This isn't what I expected"**

- Good! You're learning
- Adjust the goal, not the effort
- Document what surprised you

## The Next 90-Day Sprint

After this sprint ends:

### Sprint Review Questions

- What worked better than expected?
- What was harder than anticipated?
- What would I do differently?
- What should I double down on?
- What should I stop doing?

### The Next Sprint Planning

- Build on what worked
- Adjust what didn't
- Pick new 90-day goals
- Increase difficulty slightly
- Maintain the rhythm

## Your Career Marathon Strategy

Think of your career as a series of 90-day sprints:

**4 sprints = 1 year of progress** **12 sprints = 3 years of transformation**
**20 sprints = 5 years of compound growth**

You don't need to see the whole staircase. Just take the next step.

## Remember This

Your career isn't built in grand gestures and perfect plans. It's built in
90-day chunks of focused effort.

You've already come further than you realize. This week alone, you've:

- Clarified your vision
- Identified growth opportunities
- Built your professional presence
- Developed job search strategies
- Prepared for interviews
- Learned to negotiate
- Normalized career changes
- Created this roadmap

That's not nothing. That's everything.

Now pick your next 90 days and start running. Not sprinting frantically, not
crawling cautiously. Just running your race, at your pace, toward your goals.

You've got this. And in 90 days, you'll have proof. ðŸŽ¯

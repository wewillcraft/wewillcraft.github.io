## The Truth Nobody Tells You

Applying to 100 jobs online is like fishing in an empty pond. You're exhausted,
discouraged, and still unemployed.

Meanwhile, someone with half your skills just got hired because their friend's
cousin knew someone.

Is that fair? No. Is that reality? Yes.

So let's play the game that actually works: **Quality connections over quantity
applications.**

## Your Imposter Syndrome Is Lying

Before we dive into strategy, let's address the elephant in the room:

"I'm not qualified enough to reach out to people." "Why would anyone want to
help me?" "Everyone else seems to have it figured out."

**News flash:** Everyone feels this way. Even the senior devs. Even the CTOs.
Especially when job hunting.

The difference between people who get hired and people who don't? The ones who
get hired apply anyway, reach out anyway, show up anyway.

Your imposter syndrome is not a bug - it's a feature. It means you're pushing
yourself into growth territory. Good.

## The 10-10-10 Strategy

Forget the 100 applications. Here's what actually works:

### 10 Target Companies

Companies you genuinely want to work for. Not 50. Not "anywhere that'll hire
me." Ten.

**Your Dream 5:**

1. ---
2. ---
3. ---
4. ---
5. ---

**Your Realistic 5:**

1. ---
2. ---
3. ---
4. ---
5. ---

Research them deeply. Know their products, their challenges, their culture.

### 10 Real Connections

Not LinkedIn randos. People who could actually help or hire you.

**People to connect with:**

- Alumni from your school working in tech
- Speakers from meetups you attended
- Contributors to projects you use
- Authors of tutorials that helped you
- People whose work you genuinely admire

**Your list:**

1. ---
2. ---
3. ---
4. ---
5. ---

### 10 Quality Applications

When you do apply, make it count.

**Each application gets:**

- Tailored resume highlighting relevant experience
- Cover letter that shows you understand their problems
- Follow-up message to someone on the team
- Portfolio piece relevant to their stack
- Genuine enthusiasm for what they do

That's it. 10-10-10. Manageable, focused, effective.

## Networking for People Who Hate Networking

"Networking" sounds gross. Like you're using people. Let's reframe it:

**You're building genuine professional relationships with people whose work
interests you.**

### The Coffee Chat Formula

Stop asking for jobs. Start asking for stories.

**The approach that works:** "Hi [Name], I've been following your work on
[specific thing]. Your approach to [specific detail] really resonated with me.
I'm early in my career in [field] and would love to hear about your journey.
Could I buy you coffee (virtual or real) for 20 minutes of your time?"

**Why this works:**

- You're offering value (coffee, genuine interest)
- You're being specific (shows you did homework)
- You're time-conscious (20 minutes, not "pick your brain")
- You're not asking for a job (takes pressure off)

### The Follow-Up Game

After every conversation:

**Within 24 hours:** Send a thank you "Thanks for your time yesterday. Your
point about [specific thing] really stuck with me. I'm going to [specific action
based on their advice]."

**Within 2 weeks:** Show progress "Hey [Name], wanted to let you know I followed
your advice about [thing]. [Result]. Thanks again!"

**Every few months:** Stay visible Share an article they'd like, congratulate
them on wins, update them on your progress.

This is how "networking" becomes "having professional friends."

## Remote and Freelance: The Other Paths

Not every good opportunity is a full-time office job.

### Remote-First Companies

- Often more flexible with requirements
- Judge you on work quality, not pedigree
- Usually better work-life balance

**Where to find them:**

- RemoteOK
- We Work Remotely
- AngelList (filter for remote)
- Companies with distributed teams

### Freelance to Full-Time Pipeline

1. Start with small freelance projects
2. Deliver exceptional work
3. Become their go-to contractor
4. Convert to full-time when it makes sense

**Benefits:**

- Lower barrier to entry
- Prove yourself through work
- Build portfolio while earning
- Multiple income streams

## Try This Now (15 minutes)

**Step 1:** Pick your top 3 target companies (3 minutes)

**Step 2:** Find one person at each company to connect with (5 minutes)

- Search LinkedIn for "[Company] [Your role]"
- Look for people 1-2 levels above where you'd start
- Check if they post/write/speak publicly

**Step 3:** Draft one connection message (7 minutes)

- Mention something specific about their work
- Ask one thoughtful question
- Keep it under 100 words

Send it. Right now. Before you overthink it.

## The Weekly Rhythm

**Monday:** Research and planning (1 hour)

- Find new companies/roles
- Research your targets
- Plan the week's outreach

**Wednesday:** Connection day (1 hour)

- Send 3 connection requests
- Follow up on previous conversations
- Engage with people's content

**Friday:** Application day (2 hours)

- Submit 1-2 quality applications
- Customize everything
- Follow up on previous applications

That's 4 hours a week. Sustainable and effective.

## When Imposter Syndrome Strikes

It will. Here's your emergency kit:

### The Reality Check

- Job postings list wishes, not requirements
- If you meet 60% of the "requirements," apply
- Everyone learns on the job
- Your fresh perspective has value

### The Confidence Builders

**Before reaching out:**

- List 3 things you've built/learned recently
- Remember one problem you solved
- Read one positive piece of feedback you received

**The mantra:** "I may not know everything, but I can learn anything."

### The Perspective Shift

**Instead of:** "Why would they hire me?" **Think:** "How can I help them?"

**Instead of:** "Everyone's more qualified" **Think:** "I bring a unique
perspective"

**Instead of:** "I don't deserve this role" **Think:** "I'll grow into this
role"

## Your Job Search Tracker

Keep it simple. Track only what matters:

**For each opportunity:**

- Company name
- Role
- Contact person
- Last action taken
- Next action needed
- Energy level (üòä/üòê/üòî)

**Weekly check:**

- How many connections made?
- How many applications sent?
- How many responses received?
- What's working/not working?

## Remember This

The best job search strategy isn't about being the most qualified candidate.
It's about being the most memorable candidate who showed genuine interest and
made it easy to say yes.

Quality beats quantity. Relationships beat resumes. Authenticity beats
perfection.

And yes, you belong in those rooms you're afraid to enter. The only way to prove
it to yourself is to walk through the door. üí™

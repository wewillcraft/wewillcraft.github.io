## Why Leaders Struggle with Delegation

Most leaders know they should delegate more, but they don't. Common reasons include:

- "No one can do it as well as I can"
- "I don't want to burden others"
- "I don't have time to explain it"
- "What if they make mistakes?"

These beliefs limit both your growth and your team's development.

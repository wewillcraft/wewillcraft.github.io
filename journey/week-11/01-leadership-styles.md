Leadership isn't about being perfect or having all the answers. It's about caring enough to step up and help make things better.

Your natural leadership style is your starting point, not your limitation. The best leaders can flex between different styles depending on what the situation needs.

You don't have to wait for permission to lead. You don't need a title. You just need to start where you are, with what you have, and make a positive difference in whatever way you can.

The world needs your unique brand of leadership! üåü

## Real Talk: Nobody Knows Their 10-Year Plan

"Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"

Ugh. That question, right? Here's a secret: The person asking probably doesn't
even know where THEY'LL be in 5 years.

Life happens. Industries change. New roles get invented. The job you'll have in
10 years might not even exist yet. So let's stop pretending we can predict the
future and focus on something way more useful: **Where do you want to be next
year?**

## The 1-2 Year Sweet Spot

Here's why short-term vision actually works better:

- You can actually picture it happening
- It's close enough to take real action
- You can pivot without feeling like a failure
- It reduces that overwhelming "rest of my life" pressure

Think of it like this: You're not planning your whole career. You're just
picking your next adventure.

## What Matters to You RIGHT NOW?

Not in 10 years. Not when you're 40. in this lesson. This year. What do you
actually care about?

### Quick Priority Check (Pick Your Top 3)

‚ñ° Learning new skills fast\
‚ñ° Having evenings and weekends free\
‚ñ° Working on something meaningful\
‚ñ° Making enough to pay off loans\
‚ñ° Building a portfolio\
‚ñ° Having cool coworkers\
‚ñ° Remote work flexibility\
‚ñ° Getting mentorship\
‚ñ° Having creative freedom\
‚ñ° Job security for now

**Your top 3:** These are your compass for the next year. Everything else? Nice
to have, not essential.

## The Paths Nobody Talks About

Everyone assumes you want the traditional route: graduate ‚Üí entry-level job ‚Üí
climb ladder ‚Üí management ‚Üí retire.

But what about:

### The Portfolio Path

Build projects ‚Üí Freelance ‚Üí Pick your clients ‚Üí Maybe never get a "real job"

### The Learn-and-Leap Path

Bootcamp/self-teach ‚Üí Junior role ‚Üí Learn everything ‚Üí Jump to better role in 18
months

### The Side-Project Path

Day job that pays bills ‚Üí Passion project on the side ‚Üí Eventually it becomes
the main thing

### The Apprentice Path

Find someone doing cool work ‚Üí Offer to help for free/cheap ‚Üí Learn by doing ‚Üí
Become indispensable

### The Startup Chaos Path

Join early-stage startup ‚Üí Wear 10 hats ‚Üí Learn 10x faster ‚Üí Use that experience
anywhere

### The Big Company Cushion Path

Join established company ‚Üí Learn their processes ‚Üí Save money ‚Üí Use that
stability to plan next move

**Which path feels most "you" right now?** (You can change your mind later!)

## Your Next 12-18 Months Vision

Let's make this super concrete. Fill in the blanks:

**By [Date 1 year from now], I want to be:**

Working as a _____________ (role/title doesn't have to be formal)

At a _____________ (type of company/working for myself/figuring it out)

Making around _____________ (be realistic but optimistic)

Learning _____________ (main skill you want to develop)

## **The experience I want to gain:**

-
-

**What success looks like in 18 months:** "I'll know I'm on track when..."

## The "Good Enough for Now" Test

Your vision doesn't need to be perfect. It just needs to pass this test:

- Does it feel exciting enough to motivate you?
- Is it realistic enough that you believe it could happen?
- Does it align with what matters to you right now?
- Will it teach you something valuable?
- Can you start working toward it tomorrow?

If yes to most of these, you're good to go.

## Non-Traditional Is Not "Less Than"

Let's be super clear: Taking a non-traditional path doesn't mean you're:

- Less ambitious
- Avoiding "real work"
- Taking the easy way out
- Missing out on success

It means you're being honest about what works for YOU. And that's actually
harder than following someone else's playbook.

## Try This Now (5 minutes)

Write your "next chapter" statement:

"In the next year, I want to _____________ so I can _____________ while
_____________."

Examples:

- "In the next year, I want to **freelance part-time** so I can **build my
  portfolio** while **keeping my current job for stability**."
- "In the next year, I want to **join a small startup** so I can **learn
  everything about product development** while **working with people who inspire
  me**."
- "In the next year, I want to **focus on open source** so I can **build my
  reputation** while **learning from amazing developers**."

**Your turn:** _____________

## Permission Slips

You have permission to:

- Change your mind in 6 months
- Want different things than your classmates
- Start small
- Not have it all figured out
- Try something and decide you hate it
- Value work-life balance over prestige
- Take a "boring" job if it serves your goals

## The Direction Check

You don't need the perfect plan. You just need to know: **Am I moving toward
something or away from something?**

Moving toward: Growth, learning, excitement, alignment with values

Moving away: Boredom, burnout, misalignment, stuff that makes you feel icky

As long as you're moving toward something (even if you're not 100% sure what it
is), you're doing great.

## Remember This

Your first job won't be your last job. Your second job won't be your last job.
Honestly, your fifth job probably won't be your last job either.

Each role is just teaching you what you like, what you don't, and what you're
good at. The only "wrong" choice is not choosing at all.

You've got this. One year from now, you'll be amazed at how far you've come. üéØ

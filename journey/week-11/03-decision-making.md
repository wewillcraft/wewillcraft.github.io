When you're too close to the situation:

Write it out - you'll probably surprise yourself with how clear your advice is!

## Decision Traps (And How to Escape Them)

**The fix:** Set a research deadline. "I'll decide by Friday."

**The fix:** Make your criteria first, then evaluate options against them.

### Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)

**The fix:** Remember that most decisions are reversible or adjustable.

### People Pleasing
**What it looks like:** Choosing what others want instead of what's right for you
**The fix:** Ask yourself, "What would I choose if I didn't have to explain it to anyone?"

**My biggest decision trap:** _______________

## Quick Decision Frameworks

### The Coin Flip Trick
Assign heads to option A, tails to option B. Flip the coin. Before looking at the result, notice what you're hoping for. That's your answer! (You don't actually have to follow the coin.)

### The 5-Minute Rule
For small decisions, give yourself exactly 5 minutes to decide. Set a timer. This prevents overthinking small stuff.

### The Regret Minimization Framework
Ask yourself: "When I'm 80, which choice will I regret NOT trying?"

## Real College Decision Practice üéì

### Scenario 1: The Time Conflict
You have a job interview the same day as your best friend's birthday party.

**Low-quality decision:** Stress about it for days, then randomly pick one
**High-quality decision:** 
- What matters more right now - career building or relationships?
- Can you do both? (Interview in morning, party at night?)
- What would future you want you to choose?
- Can you be honest with your friend about the situation?

### Scenario 2: The Major Doubt
You're in engineering but starting to think you'd rather do marketing.

**Low-quality decision:** Switch immediately or ignore the feeling completely
**High-quality decision:**
- What specifically draws you to marketing?
- Can you test this interest before switching? (Take a class, find an internship, shadow someone)
- What are you actually dissatisfied with in engineering?
- Talk to people in both fields about their real experiences

### Scenario 3: The Social Pressure
All your friends are going to an expensive spring break trip you can't really afford.

**Low-quality decision:** Go into debt to fit in, or skip without explanation
**High-quality decision:**
- Be honest: "I'd love to go but need to stick to my budget"
- Suggest alternatives: "Want to plan a cheaper local adventure instead?"
- Remember your values: Is temporary fun worth long-term financial stress?

## Your Decision-Making Upgrade Plan

### This Week's Practice:
**Monday:** Use the 5-minute rule for 3 small decisions
**Wednesday:** Try the 10-10-10 rule on something you're overthinking  
**Friday:** Make one decision you've been avoiding

### Daily Decision Hygiene:
- **Morning:** "What decisions do I need to make today?"
- **Evening:** "What did I decide today, and how did it go?"

### Decision Success Metrics:
‚ñ° I'm making decisions faster
‚ñ° I'm involving the right people at the right time
‚ñ° I'm learning from outcomes without beating myself up
‚ñ° I feel more confident about my choices
‚ñ° I'm not constantly second-guessing myself

## The Different Types of Decisions

**Reversible Decisions:** Choosing classes, joining clubs, most relationship choices
‚Üí Make these faster! You can adjust.

**Irreversible Decisions:** Dropping out, burning bridges, having kids
‚Üí Take more time, get advice, really think it through.

**High-Stakes Decisions:** College choice, career direction, who to trust
‚Üí Use formal frameworks, involve mentors.

**Low-Stakes Decisions:** What to wear, what to eat, weekend plans
‚Üí 5-minute rule or gut instinct.

## Building Your Decision Confidence

### Start Small
Practice on low-stakes decisions first. The confidence you build choosing restaurants will help you choose internships later.

### Own Your Choices
Once you decide, commit. Even if it doesn't work out perfectly, you'll learn something valuable.

### Learn From Every Outcome
Good outcome = What made this work?  
Bad outcome = What would I do differently next time?  
No judgment, just learning.

### Trust Your Growth
Your decision-making will improve with practice. Give yourself credit for making thoughtful choices, even when they don't work out perfectly.

## Emergency Decision Protocol

When you absolutely have to decide RIGHT NOW:

1. **Take 3 deep breaths**
2. **What are my top 2 options?**
3. **Which aligns better with my values?**
4. **What would I tell my best friend to do?**
5. **Go with that choice**
6. **Learn from the outcome later**

Remember: A good decision made quickly is usually better than a perfect decision made too late.

## The Bottom Line

You don't need to be right 100% of the time. You just need to be thoughtful, learn from outcomes, and keep improving. Every decision is practice for the next one.

The students who seem to have it all figured out? They're just getting better at making decisions quickly and adjusting as they go. You can absolutely do this too! üí™

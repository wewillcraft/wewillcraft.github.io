## Time to Practice üí™

You've learned the theory. Now let's put it to work with real scenarios you'll actually face. No fluff, just practice.

## Scenario 1: The Unclear Requirements

**Situation:** Your PM sends this Slack message:
"Hey, we need that thing we talked about done by EOW. Make sure it's scalable and user-friendly. Thanks!"

**Your Mission:** Get clarity without being annoying.

### Bad Response
"What thing? This is too vague."

### Good Response
"Hey! Want to make sure I deliver what you need. Quick clarification:
- Which feature from our Tuesday discussion?
- By scalable, are we talking 100 users or 10k?
- Any specific UX patterns you want me to follow?
Can sync for 5 mins if easier."

**Practice:** Write your version. Make it friendly but get specifics.

## Scenario 2: The Credit Thief

**Situation:** In the all-hands, your manager presents YOUR authentication system as their idea. The CEO loves it.

**Your Mission:** Reclaim credit professionally.

### The Approach
1. Don't react in the moment
2. Private message after: "Great presentation! I'm excited the auth system I built is getting recognition. For the follow-up deck, happy to add technical details about the implementation."
3. Follow up with evidence trail

**Practice:** Write that message. Balance assertiveness with professionalism.

## Scenario 3: The Harsh Code Review

**Situation:** Senior dev comments on your PR:
"This is completely wrong. Did you even read the docs? Rewrite everything."

**Your Mission:** Respond constructively despite feeling attacked.

### Your Response Template
"Thanks for the review. To make sure I fix this correctly:
- Which specific patterns should I follow?
- Is there example code in our codebase I should reference?
- What documentation section covers this?"

**Practice:** Stay professional. Seek learning. Don't defend.

## Scenario 4: The Meeting Dominator

**Situation:** Every standup, Alex talks for 10 minutes about irrelevant details while everyone zones out.

**Your Mission:** Address it without creating conflict.

### Private Message Approach
"Hey Alex! You always have great technical insights. I noticed standups are running long - what if we did a separate deep-dive session for complex topics? That way we could really dig in without time pressure."

**Practice:** Write a message that redirects without shaming.

## Scenario 5: The Presentation Panic

**Situation:** You need to present the new architecture to 50 people, including C-level executives. You're terrified.

**Your Mission:** Prepare and deliver without dying.

### Your Prep Checklist
```markdown
Tonight:
[ ] Create 5 slides max (problem, solution, impact, timeline, questions)
[ ] Practice once out loud
[ ] Write opening sentence
[ ] Prepare for 3 likely questions
[ ] Set up tech backup plan

Day of presentation:
[ ] Power pose for 2 mins
[ ] Test all tech 30 mins before
[ ] Keep water nearby
[ ] Remember: They want you to succeed
```

**Practice:** Write your opening sentence. Make it confident and clear.

## Scenario 6: The Networking Event

**Situation:** Company mixer. You know nobody. Everyone's in groups already.

**Your Mission:** Make one meaningful connection.

### The Strategy
1. Find someone else standing alone
2. Approach with: "Mind if I join you? These events can be overwhelming."
3. Ask: "What team are you on? What are you working on?"
4. Listen more than talk
5. Exchange contact before leaving

**Practice:** Write three conversation starters that feel natural to you.

## Scenario 7: The Salary Negotiation

**Situation:** You discovered you're paid 20% less than peers. Annual review is coming.

**Your Mission:** Ask for fair compensation.

### Your Script
"I'd like to discuss my compensation. Based on my research and contributions:
- I'm currently below market rate for my role
- I've delivered [specific achievements]
- I'd like to discuss an adjustment to [specific number]
What would you need to see from me to make this happen?"

**Practice:** List your three strongest achievements and their impact.

## Scenario 8: The Burnout Conversation

**Situation:** You're overwhelmed, working weekends, and quality is slipping.

**Your Mission:** Set boundaries without seeming uncommitted.

### The Approach
"I want to deliver quality work and I'm concerned about sustainability. I'm currently juggling X projects. Can we prioritize what's most critical? I want to do fewer things better rather than everything poorly."

**Practice:** Write your version. Be honest but solution-focused.

## Your Communication Workout Plan

### Week 1: Foundation
- Practice one scenario daily
- Focus on clarity and brevity
- Get comfortable with templates

### Week 2: Personality Adaptation
- Identify three colleagues' styles
- Adapt one message for each style
- Notice the response differences

### Week 3: Difficult Conversations
- Have one boundary-setting conversation
- Give one piece of constructive feedback
- Ask for something you need

### Week 4: Integration
- Lead one meeting
- Network with one new person
- Negotiate one deadline or requirement

## The Quick Reference Scripts

### When You Need Time
"Let me think about that and get back to you by [specific time]."

### When You're Lost
"I want to make sure I understand. Could you give me an example?"

### When You Disagree
"I see it differently. Can I share my perspective?"

### When You're Overwhelmed
"I need to recalibrate my priorities. What's most critical?"

### When Someone's Wrong
"I might be missing something, but I think..."

## Self-Assessment Checklist

Rate yourself (1-5) on each:

‚ñ° I can ask for clarification without seeming incompetent
‚ñ° I can give feedback without creating defensiveness
‚ñ° I can receive criticism without taking it personally
‚ñ° I can adapt my style to different personalities
‚ñ° I can set boundaries professionally
‚ñ° I can network without feeling fake
‚ñ° I can present ideas clearly under pressure
‚ñ° I can navigate conflict constructively

## Your 30-Day Challenge

Pick your three weakest areas from above. Then:

**Days 1-10:** Observe others who do it well
**Days 11-20:** Practice in low-stakes situations
**Days 21-30:** Apply in real situations

Track what works. Adjust what doesn't. Build your own style.

## Remember This

Communication skills are like coding skills‚Äîyou get better through practice, not theory. Every conversation is a rep. Every email is practice. Every meeting is a chance to improve.

You don't need to be perfect. You just need to be clear, respectful, and willing to adjust when something's not working.

The best communicators aren't born‚Äîthey're built through thousands of small interactions where they chose to be intentional instead of reactive.

Start today. Practice with the next person you talk to.

# Written Communication Mastery

**Time:** 75 minutes\
**Purpose:** Master the art of written communication in professional settings

## The Developer's Writing Challenge

As developers, we often think in code but must communicate in prose. This lesson bridges that gap, helping you write with the same clarity and precision you bring to programming.

## Part 1: Email Effectiveness (20 minutes)

### The SCRAP Framework

**S**ubject Line: Clear and actionable\
**C**ontext: Brief background\
**R**equest: What you need\
**A**ction: Next steps\
**P**oliteness: Professional tone

### Email Templates by Purpose

**Bug Report:**

```
Subject: [BUG] Payment processing failing on checkout

Hi [Name],

Context: Users reporting payment failures since deploy #234.

Issue: Stripe API returning 500 errors on card validation.

Request: Need backend team to investigate logs from 2PM-4PM.

Next Steps: I'll pause the deploy pipeline until resolved.

Thanks,
[Your name]
```

**Project Update:**

```
Subject: [UPDATE] Project Alpha - Week 9 Progress

Team,

This week:
✓ Completed user authentication
✓ API integration 80% done
⚠ Database migration delayed

Next week:
- Finish API integration
- Start frontend testing
- Address migration blocker

Blockers: Need DBA support for migration.

[Your name]
```

### Email Anti-Patterns

Avoid:

- Walls of text
- Unclear asks
- Missing context
- No action items
- Reply-all abuse
- Emotional responses

## Part 2: Documentation Clarity (25 minutes)

### The Developer's Documentation Guide

**README Structure:**

1. What it does (one sentence)
2. Quick start (< 5 steps)
3. Installation
4. Usage examples
5. API reference
6. Contributing
7. License

**Code Comments:**

```javascript
// BAD: Increments i
i++;

// GOOD: Retry counter for API calls (max 3 attempts)
retryCount++;

// BEST: Exponential backoff retry counter
// Waits 2^n seconds between attempts (max 3)
// See: https://docs/patterns/retry
backoffRetryCount++;
```

### Documentation by Personality

**For Detail-Oriented Types (ISTJ, INTJ):**

- Comprehensive specs
- Edge cases documented
- Version history
- Migration guides

**For Big-Picture Types (ENFP, ENTP):**

- Concept overviews
- Architecture diagrams
- Use case examples
- Quick wins

## Part 3: Slack/Chat Excellence (15 minutes)

### Async Communication Rules

**Do:**

- Use threads
- Edit instead of multi-message
- Include context
- Use reactions for acknowledgment
- Search before asking

**Don't:**

- @here unnecessarily
- DM without permission
- Expect immediate responses
- Use chat for complex discussions
- Share sensitive info

### Message Formatting

**Good:**

```
🐛 Bug found in auth flow
- Affects: Login with Google
- Severity: High
- Repro: [steps]
- Investigating: @alice
```

**Better:**

```
🔥 PROD ISSUE: Auth service down
Impact: All users locked out
Started: 2:45 PM EST
Lead: @bob
Thread: Updates below 👇
```

## Part 4: PR Descriptions (15 minutes)

### The Perfect Pull Request

```markdown
## What Changed

- Added user authentication
- Implemented JWT tokens
- Created login/logout endpoints

## Why

Addresses #123 - Users need secure access

## Testing

- ✅ Unit tests added
- ✅ Integration tests pass
- ✅ Manual testing completed

## Screenshots

[Before] [After]

## Notes

- Breaking change: API now requires auth header
- Migration required: Run `npm run migrate`
```

### Code Review Comments

**Constructive:**

```
"Consider extracting this logic into a helper function for reusability. 
See similar pattern in utils/auth.js:42"
```

**Not:**

```
"This is wrong."
```

## Your Written Communication Audit

Rate yourself (1-10):

| Skill           | Current | Goal | Action |
| --------------- | ------- | ---- | ------ |
| Email clarity   | _/10    | _/10 |        |
| Documentation   | _/10    | _/10 |        |
| Chat efficiency | _/10    | _/10 |        |
| PR descriptions | _/10    | _/10 |        |
| Code comments   | _/10    | _/10 |        |

## This Week's Practice

1. Rewrite one old email using SCRAP
2. Document one undocumented function
3. Create a PR template for your team
4. Practice thread discipline in Slack

## Key Takeaway

Written communication is async programming for humans. Like good code, good writing is clear, concise, and purposeful. Master this, and you'll stand out in any team.

# Feedback Skills

**Time:** 75 minutes\
**Purpose:** Master the art of giving and receiving feedback effectively

## The Feedback Loop

Feedback is a gift. Whether giving or receiving, it's an opportunity for growth. The challenge is making it constructive, actionable, and relationship-building rather than destructive.

## Part 1: Giving Feedback (30 minutes)

### The SBI Model

**S**ituation - When and where\
**B**ehavior - What specifically happened\
**I**mpact - The effect it had

#### Example:

"During yesterday's client meeting [Situation], when you interrupted the client three times [Behavior], it made them seem frustrated and we lost momentum in our pitch [Impact]."

### Types of Feedback

**Appreciative Feedback**

- Recognizes strengths
- Reinforces positive behaviors
- Builds confidence
- Formula: "I noticed when you [behavior], it resulted in [positive impact]."

**Developmental Feedback**

- Addresses growth areas
- Offers specific improvements
- Focuses on future
- Formula: "Next time you [situation], try [alternative behavior] to achieve [desired outcome]."

### Feedback Don'ts

- Don't make it personal ("You're lazy")
- Don't use absolutes ("You always/never")
- Don't compare to others ("Why can't you be like...")
- Don't sandwich criticism (it dilutes both messages)
- Don't wait too long (feedback has an expiration date)

### Making Feedback Actionable

**Poor:** "Your presentations need work."

**Better:** "Your presentation content is solid. To increase engagement, try adding one visual per slide and making eye contact with different audience members every 30 seconds."

## Part 2: Receiving Feedback (30 minutes)

### The HEAR Method

**H**alt internal reaction\
**E**ngage with curiosity\
**A**sk clarifying questions\
**R**espond thoughtfully

### Managing Your Response

**In the Moment:**

1. Breathe before responding
2. Say "Thank you for the feedback"
3. Ask "Can you give me a specific example?"
4. Take notes (it shows you value it)
5. Summarize what you heard
6. Don't defend immediately

**After the Conversation:**

1. Process emotions privately
2. Look for the grain of truth
3. Decide what to act on
4. Follow up on changes made

### Questions to Ask

- "What specifically could I do differently?"
- "What would success look like to you?"
- "Can you help me understand the impact?"
- "What's the most important thing to focus on?"
- "How will I know I'm improving?"

### When Feedback Feels Unfair

1. **The 24-Hour Rule**: Wait before responding emotionally
2. **The 10% Rule**: Find the 10% that might be true
3. **The Pattern Check**: Is this feedback recurring?
4. **The Source Check**: Consider the giver's perspective
5. **The Growth Lens**: How can this help me grow?

## Part 3: Creating Feedback Culture (15 minutes)

### Regular Feedback Practices

**Weekly 1-on-1s**

- Start with wins
- Address challenges
- Plan improvements
- End with support offered

**Project Retrospectives**

- What went well?
- What could improve?
- What will we change?
- What did we learn?

**Peer Feedback Sessions**

- Structured format
- Rotating schedule
- Specific topics
- Action items tracked

### Asking for Feedback

**Proactive Scripts:**

"I'm working on [skill]. Could you observe me during [situation] and give me feedback on how I'm doing?"

"After our next meeting, could you share one thing I did well and one area for improvement?"

"I value your perspective. What's one thing I could do to be more effective in my role?"

### Building Trust for Feedback

- Model receiving feedback well
- Give more positive than negative
- Be specific and timely
- Follow up on feedback given
- Create safe spaces for honesty

- "You're not strategic enough"
- "You did an amazing job on that project"

## Key Takeaway

Feedback is not about being right or wrong; it's about getting better. The best professionals actively seek feedback, gracefully receive it, and thoughtfully give it.

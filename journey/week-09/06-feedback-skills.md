# Feedback Skills

**Time:** 75 minutes\
**Purpose:** Master the art of giving and receiving feedback effectively

## The Feedback Loop

Feedback is a gift. Whether giving or receiving, it's an opportunity for growth. The challenge is making it constructive, actionable, and relationship-building rather than destructive.

## Part 1: Giving Feedback (30 minutes)

### The SBI Model

**S**ituation - When and where\
**B**ehavior - What specifically happened\
**I**mpact - The effect it had

#### Example:

"During yesterday's client meeting [Situation], when you interrupted the client three times [Behavior], it made them seem frustrated and we lost momentum in our pitch [Impact]."

### Types of Feedback

**Appreciative Feedback**

- Recognizes strengths
- Reinforces positive behaviors
- Builds confidence
- Formula: "I noticed when you [behavior], it resulted in [positive impact]."

**Developmental Feedback**

- Addresses growth areas
- Offers specific improvements
- Focuses on future
- Formula: "Next time you [situation], try [alternative behavior] to achieve [desired outcome]."

### Feedback Don'ts

- Don't make it personal ("You're lazy")
- Don't use absolutes ("You always/never")
- Don't compare to others ("Why can't you be like...")
- Don't sandwich criticism (it dilutes both messages)
- Don't wait too long (feedback has an expiration date)

### Making Feedback Actionable

**Poor:** "Your presentations need work."

**Better:** "Your presentation content is solid. To increase engagement, try adding one visual per slide and making eye contact with different audience members every 30 seconds."

## Part 2: Receiving Feedback (30 minutes)

### The HEAR Method

**H**alt internal reaction\
**E**ngage with curiosity\
**A**sk clarifying questions\
**R**espond thoughtfully

### Managing Your Response

**In the Moment:**

1. Breathe before responding
2. Say "Thank you for the feedback"
3. Ask "Can you give me a specific example?"
4. Take notes (it shows you value it)
5. Summarize what you heard
6. Don't defend immediately

**After the Conversation:**

1. Process emotions privately
2. Look for the grain of truth
3. Decide what to act on
4. Follow up on changes made

### Questions to Ask

- "What specifically could I do differently?"
- "What would success look like to you?"
- "Can you help me understand the impact?"
- "What's the most important thing to focus on?"
- "How will I know I'm improving?"

### When Feedback Feels Unfair

1. **The 24-Hour Rule**: Wait before responding emotionally
2. **The 10% Rule**: Find the 10% that might be true
3. **The Pattern Check**: Is this feedback recurring?
4. **The Source Check**: Consider the giver's perspective
5. **The Growth Lens**: How can this help me grow?

## Part 3: Creating Feedback Culture (15 minutes)

### Regular Feedback Practices

**Weekly 1-on-1s**

- Start with wins
- Address challenges
- Plan improvements
- End with support offered

**Project Retrospectives**

- What went well?
- What could improve?
- What will we change?
- What did we learn?

**Peer Feedback Sessions**

- Structured format
- Rotating schedule
- Specific topics
- Action items tracked

### Asking for Feedback

**Proactive Scripts:**

"I'm working on [skill]. Could you observe me during [situation] and give me feedback on how I'm doing?"

"After our next meeting, could you share one thing I did well and one area for improvement?"

"I value your perspective. What's one thing I could do to be more effective in my role?"

### Building Trust for Feedback

- Model receiving feedback well
- Give more positive than negative
- Be specific and timely
- Follow up on feedback given
- Create safe spaces for honesty

## Your Feedback Action Plan

## Practice Scenarios

### Giving Feedback Practice

Practice these with SBI model:

- Teammate missing deadlines
- Manager micromanaging
- Direct report's excellent problem-solving
- Peer's negative attitude

### Receiving Feedback Practice

Role-play responses to:

- "You talk too much in meetings"
- "Your work quality has declined"
- "You're not strategic enough"
- "You did an amazing job on that project"

## Advanced Feedback Frameworks

### The COIN-R Model (Enhanced SBI)

**C**ontext: Situation and setting
**O**bservation: Specific behavior witnessed
**I**mpact: Effect on results/people/situation
**N**ext Steps: Future expectations
**R**esources: Support offered

**Example:**
"During yesterday's client demo (Context), when you handled the unexpected question about security protocols (Observation), your thorough explanation clearly impressed the client and they immediately asked about next steps (Impact). For future demos, continue that level of preparation and consider preparing a few additional deep-dive topics (Next Steps). I'm happy to help you identify likely technical questions for upcoming presentations (Resources)."

### The GROW Model for Developmental Feedback

**G**oal: What do they want to achieve?
**R**eality: What's the current situation?
**O**ptions: What possibilities exist?
**W**ay Forward: What specific actions will they take?

**Example Conversation:**
"What would success look like for you in code reviews? (Goal)"
"How do you feel your reviews are going currently? (Reality)"
"What different approaches could you try? (Options)"
"Which of these will you commit to trying this week? (Way Forward)"

### Personality-Adapted Feedback

### For Thinking Types (T):
**Focus on:**
- Logic and reasoning
- Objective criteria
- Performance metrics
- Systems and processes

**Example:**
"Based on the performance metrics, your API response times improved by 40% after the optimization. The logical approach you took to identify bottlenecks was thorough. For the next optimization cycle, consider also analyzing memory usage patterns."

### For Feeling Types (F):
**Focus on:**
- People impact
- Team dynamics
- Personal growth
- Values alignment

**Example:**
"Your mentoring of the junior developers has really boosted team morale. Sarah mentioned how your patient explanations helped her understand microservices. As you continue growing as a mentor, you might also consider documenting some of your teaching approaches for other senior developers."

### For Sensing Types (S):
**Focus on:**
- Specific examples
- Concrete details
- Step-by-step guidance
- Past experiences

**Example:**
"In yesterday's sprint planning meeting, when you broke down the authentication feature into specific tasks with time estimates, it helped the whole team understand the complexity. Similar to how you handled the payment integration last quarter, continue providing that level of detail for complex features."

### For Intuitive Types (N):
**Focus on:**
- Big picture impact
- Future possibilities
- Conceptual connections
- Innovation opportunities

**Example:**
"Your architectural proposal connects well with our long-term scalability goals. The way you're thinking about modularity positions us for the AI integration we discussed for next year. As you develop this further, consider how it might also enable the multi-tenant features on our roadmap."

### Cultural Adaptations for Feedback

### High-Context Cultures (Asian, Middle Eastern):
**Approach:**
- Use indirect language
- Provide face-saving options
- Focus on collective benefits
- Allow processing time
- Use third-person references

**Example:**
"The team has been discussing ways to improve our code quality metrics. Some approaches that have worked well for other developers include peer programming and automated testing. What thoughts do you have on these approaches?"

### Low-Context Cultures (German, Nordic):
**Approach:**
- Be direct and specific
- Focus on facts and results
- Provide immediate feedback
- Separate person from performance
- Value efficiency

**Example:**
"Your code quality has room for improvement. Specifically, the functions in the user module average 50 lines when our standard is 20. This makes debugging more difficult. Please refactor these by Friday."

### Advanced Receiving Techniques

### The SOAR Method for Processing Feedback:

**S**top: Pause your defensive reactions
**O**bserve: What emotions are coming up?
**A**nalyze: What's useful in this feedback?
**R**espond: Choose your response thoughtfully

### Feedback Filtering Framework

**Source Credibility Check:**
- Does this person have context for the situation?
- Do they have relevant expertise?
- What might be motivating their feedback?
- Is there a pattern from multiple sources?

**Content Analysis:**
- What specific behaviors are mentioned?
- What impact is described?
- How actionable are the suggestions?
- What resonates as true?

**Timing and Context:**
- What was happening when this behavior occurred?
- Were there external factors affecting performance?
- Is this a one-time or recurring pattern?
- What was my emotional state at the time?

### Managing Defensive Responses

### Common Defensive Patterns:

**The Deflector:**
"But everyone does that"
**Response:** "Help me understand what I specifically should change"

**The Excuse Maker:**
"I only did that because..."
**Response:** "You're right, there were factors involved. What could I do differently in similar situations?"

**The Counter-Attacker:**
"Well, you do X too"
**Response:** "I appreciate you pointing that out. Let's focus on what I can improve first"

**The Minimizer:**
"It's not that big a deal"
**Response:** "Help me understand the impact from your perspective"

### Feedback in Different Professional Contexts

### Code Review Feedback

**Technical Feedback Best Practices:**

**Poor:**
"This is wrong"

**Better:**
"Consider using a Map instead of nested loops here for better performance"

**Best:**
"This nested loop approach works, and I wonder if using a Map might improve performance for larger datasets. Here's a similar pattern from our utils library: [link]. What do you think?"

**Code Review Receiving:**
- Thank reviewers for their time
- Ask clarifying questions
- Explain your reasoning when helpful
- Separate technical preferences from requirements
- Learn from experienced developers' suggestions

### Design Review Feedback

**Design Feedback Framework:**

**User Experience Level:**
"From a user perspective, this flow feels intuitive. The checkout process follows expected patterns."

**Visual Design Level:**
"The color contrast meets accessibility standards. Consider increasing the button size for mobile users."

**Technical Implementation:**
"This design is feasible with our current component library. The animation might impact performance on older devices."

### Performance Review Feedback

### The SMART+ Framework:

**S**pecific: Concrete examples and behaviors
**M**easurable: Quantifiable outcomes when possible
**A**chievable: Realistic expectations
**R**elevant: Connected to role and goals
**T**ime-bound: Clear timeframes
**+Growth-Oriented**: Focus on development

**Example:**
"Your technical leadership has grown significantly this year (Growth). Specifically, you led the database migration project that reduced query times by 60% (Specific, Measurable). For next quarter, I'd like you to focus on developing your presentation skills for executive audiences (Achievable, Relevant).

## Key Takeaway

Feedback is not about being right or wrong; it's about getting better. The best professionals actively seek feedback, gracefully receive it, and thoughtfully give it.

Master feedback givers understand that their job is not to judge or criticize, but to help others see their blind spots and unlock their potential. Master feedback receivers understand that every piece of feedback—even poorly delivered feedback—contains a grain of truth that can help them grow.

The highest performing teams and organizations are those that have mastered the art of continuous feedback. They've created cultures where feedback flows freely in all directions, where people compete to give the most helpful input, and where growth happens in real-time rather than waiting for annual reviews.

Your ability to give and receive feedback effectively will determine not just your own growth, but your ability to help others reach their potential. Master this skill, and you'll become someone others seek out for guidance and development.

### Feedback in Agile and Scrum Environments

**Sprint Retrospectives with Feedback Focus:**

Traditional retrospectives often focus on processes, but the most effective teams also address interpersonal feedback:

**Enhanced Retrospective Format:**
1. **Process Review** (15 minutes): What went well/poorly with our workflow
2. **Collaboration Review** (15 minutes): How did we work together as humans
3. **Individual Feedback** (15 minutes): Rotating peer feedback using SBI model
4. **Action Planning** (10 minutes): Specific process AND relationship improvements
5. **Appreciation Round** (5 minutes): Positive feedback to close

**Continuous Feedback in Daily Standups:**

**Traditional Format:**
- What I did yesterday
- What I'll do today  
- What's blocking me

**Feedback-Enhanced Format:**
- What I accomplished (brief)
- What I'm working on (brief)
- What support I need (technical and interpersonal)
- One piece of feedback for the team (appreciation or improvement)

### Feedback for Different Technical Roles

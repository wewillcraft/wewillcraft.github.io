# Networking Mastery

**Time:** 90 minutes\
**Purpose:** Transform networking from awkward obligation to genuine relationship building

## Reframing Networking

Networking isn't about collecting contacts; it's about planting gardens. You plant seeds (connections), nurture them (follow-ups), and eventually harvest mutual benefits (opportunities).

## Part 1: Networking Strategy (20 minutes)

### Your Networking Goals

**Quality Over Quantity**

- 5 strong connections > 50 business cards
- Depth matters more than breadth
- Focus on mutual value exchange

### The Three Circles of Networking

**Inner Circle (5-10 people)**

- Career sponsors and mentors
- Close professional allies
- Regular meaningful contact
- Deep mutual support

**Middle Circle (30-50 people)**

- Industry colleagues
- Former teammates
- Monthly/quarterly touchpoints
- Professional exchanges

**Outer Circle (150+ people)**

- Acquaintances and contacts
- Annual touchpoints
- LinkedIn connections
- Conference contacts

### Networking Personality Types

**For Introverts:**

- Focus on 1-on-1 conversations
- Arrive early when crowds are smaller
- Set a goal (meet 3 people)
- Take breaks to recharge
- Follow up via written communication

**For Extraverts:**

- Use energy to help introverts
- Quality over quantity conversations
- Be the connector for others
- Don't dominate conversations
- Remember to listen actively

## Part 2: Event Networking (30 minutes)

### Your 30-Second Introduction

**Formula:** Who you are + What you do + Interesting hook

"Mind if I join you? I'm [name]."

**Include Others:**
"Have you met [person]? They work in [relevant area]."

**Exit Gracefully:**

- "I promised myself I'd meet five new people tonight."
- "I want to catch [speaker] before they leave."

"Hi [Name], I came across your [work/article/profile] on [platform] and was impressed by [specific thing]. I'm also working in [related area] and would love to learn about your experience with [specific topic]. Would you be open to a brief virtual coffee?"

**Asking for Introduction:**
"Hi [Name], I noticed you're connected with [Person] at [Company]. I'm interested in [specific area] they work in. Would you be comfortable making an introduction? I can send you a brief blurb about myself to make it easier."

**Following Up:**
"Hi [Name], Great meeting you at [event] yesterday. I enjoyed our conversation about [topic], especially your insights on [specific point]. Here's the [resource] I mentioned. Would love to continue the conversation over coffee next week if you're interested."

Networking is just making friends with a purpose. Focus on being interested rather than interesting, giving rather than getting, and building genuine relationships rather than collecting contacts.

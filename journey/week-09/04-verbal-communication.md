# Verbal Communication Skills

**Time:** 60 minutes
**Purpose:** Develop effective verbal communication for professional settings

## Your Verbal Communication Style

Based on your personality type, you likely have natural tendencies:

**Introverts:** Think before speaking, prefer depth over breadth
**Extroverts:** Think while speaking, comfortable with spontaneity
**Thinkers:** Focus on logic and accuracy
**Feelers:** Consider impact on people

Work with your style, not against it.

## Part 1: Meeting Participation (20 minutes)

### The PREP Framework

**P**oint: State your main idea
**R**eason: Why it matters
**E**xample: Concrete evidence
**P**oint: Restate conclusion

**Example:**
"I think we should refactor the auth module (Point). It's causing 40% of our bugs (Reason). Last week alone, we had three production issues traced back to it (Example). Refactoring now will save us time long-term (Point)."

### Meeting Strategies by Personality

**For Introverts:**

- Review agenda beforehand
- Prepare talking points
- Speak early to build momentum
- Use chat for follow-ups

**For Extroverts:**

- Practice pausing
- Write key points first
- Let others finish
- Summarize at the end

### Active Participation Techniques

1. **The Bridge:** "Building on what Sarah said..."
2. **The Question:** "What if we considered..."
3. **The Summary:** "So we're saying..."
4. **The Alternative:** "Another approach might be..."
5. **The Clarification:** "To make sure I understand..."

## Part 2: Presentation Skills (20 minutes)

### The 10-20-30 Rule

- 10 slides maximum
- 20 minutes maximum
- 30 point font minimum

### Presentation Structure

**Hook** (30 seconds)

- Question, statistic, or story
- Why they should care

**Problem** (2 minutes)

- Current pain points
- Cost of not solving

**Solution** (10 minutes)

- Your approach
- Technical details (appropriate level)
- Demo if possible

**Benefits** (3 minutes)

- What changes
- ROI/impact

**Next Steps** (1 minute)

- Clear call to action
- Timeline

### Managing Presentation Anxiety

**Before:**

- Practice out loud 3x
- Prepare for questions
- Test all tech
- Arrive early

**During:**

- Breathe deeply
- Make eye contact with friendly faces
- Use gestures
- Pause instead of "um"

**Recovery:**

- "Let me think about that"
- "Good question, let's discuss after"
- "I'll follow up with details"

## Part 3: One-on-One Conversations (20 minutes)

### The 1-on-1 Framework

**Check-in:** How are you?
**Update:** Current status
**Discuss:** Main topics
**Align:** Next steps
**Close:** Anything else?

### Difficult Technical Discussions

**When explaining complex topics:**

1. Start with the why
2. Use analogies
3. Check understanding
4. Provide examples
5. Offer resources

**Example:**
"Think of microservices like a restaurant kitchen. Instead of one chef doing everything, you have specialized stations. Each service is like a station—it does one thing really well and communicates with others through defined interfaces."

### Virtual Communication Tips

**Video Calls:**

- Look at camera, not screen
- Mute when not speaking
- Use names when addressing people
- Summarize action items

**Phone Calls:**

- Stand up for energy
- Smile (it's audible)
- Take notes
- Confirm understanding

## Key Phrases That Work

**To buy time:**

- "Have we considered..."

**To show engagement:**

- "To summarize, we agreed..."

## This Week's Challenge

Record yourself in three different scenarios:

2. Leading a discussion
3. Presenting an idea

Notice patterns in:

- Filler words
- Pace
- Volume
- Clarity

## Key Takeaway

Verbal communication is about connection, not perfection. Focus on clarity and authenticity over polish. Your unique perspective is valuable—learn to share it effectively.

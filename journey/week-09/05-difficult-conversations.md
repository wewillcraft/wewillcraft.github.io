## The Conversations We Avoid üò¨

You know the ones. That coworker who takes credit for your work. The code review that got personal. The manager who keeps changing requirements. The teammate who... doesn't actually do any work.

We need to talk about them. Today, we learn how.

## Why We Avoid Conflict

Real talk - conflict feels dangerous because your brain literally thinks it is. Same fight-or-flight response as seeing a tiger, except the tiger is Bob from DevOps.

**Common avoidance tactics:**

- "It's not that big a deal" (it is)
- "Maybe it'll fix itself" (it won't)
- "I don't want to be difficult" (setting boundaries isn't difficult)
- "What if they get mad?" (they might, and that's okay)

## The Pre-Conversation Prep

Before you open your mouth:

### The Clarity Check

Ask yourself:

1. What EXACTLY is the problem? (facts, not feelings)
2. What do I want to change?
3. What's my ideal outcome?
4. What can I actually control?

### The Story You're Telling

We all create narratives. Check yours:

- **Villain Story:** "They're doing this TO me"
- **Victim Story:** "I'm helpless here"
- **Hero Story:** "I'm the only one who cares"

Reality: Everyone's the hero of their own story. Find the human.

## The Conversation Framework

### The SBI Model

**S**ituation: When and where
**B**ehavior: What specifically happened\
**I**mpact: The actual effect

```
"In yesterday's standup (S),
you interrupted me three times (B),
which made me lose my train of thought and 
feel like my input wasn't valued (I)."
```

### The Crucial First 30 Seconds

```
"Hey, can we talk about something? 
I've been feeling [emotion] about [situation].
I'd like to understand your perspective and 
find a way forward that works for both of us."
```

Boom. Non-threatening. Clear intent. Opens dialogue.

## Common Difficult Conversations

### "You took credit for my work"

"In the presentation, the auth system I built was presented as your work. I'm sure that wasn't intentional, but I'd like credit for my contributions. How can we handle this going forward?"

### "Your code reviews are harsh"

"I value your technical expertise, and I'm finding the tone of recent reviews demotivating. Could we discuss how to keep feedback constructive?"

### "You're not pulling your weight"

"I've noticed I'm handling most of the sprint tasks. Can we talk about workload distribution? I want to make sure we're both set up for success."

### "Stop micromanaging me"

"I work best with some autonomy. Could we agree on checkpoints that give you the visibility you need while giving me space to work?"

## When Things Get Heated

### The Circuit Breaker

"I'm getting emotional and want to have a productive conversation. Can we take 5 minutes/revisit this tomorrow?"

### The Repeat-Back

"Let me make sure I understand. You're saying that... [repeat their point]. Is that right?"

### The Common Ground

"We both want this project to succeed. How do we get there together?"

## The Personality Factor

### With Thinkers

- Lead with logic and data
- Keep emotions minimal
- Focus on systems and processes

### With Feelers

- Acknowledge emotions first
- Emphasize relationships
- Show you care about them as a person

### With Direct People

- Get to the point fast
- Don't sugar-coat
- Be specific about next steps

### With Indirect People

- Soften your approach
- Give context
- Allow processing time

## After the Conversation

### The Follow-Through

- Send a summary email (paper trail)
- Check in after a week
- Acknowledge improvements
- Course-correct if needed

### Sample Follow-Up

```
"Thanks for the conversation earlier.
To summarize what we agreed:
- [Point 1]
- [Point 2]
Let me know if I missed anything."
```

## Your Difficult Conversation Prep Sheet

**The Situation:**

- What happened? (facts only)
- When/where did it happen?
- Who was involved?

**The Impact:**

- How did it affect you?
- How did it affect the work?
- Why does it matter?

**The Request:**

- What specific change do you want?
- What are you willing to compromise on?
- What's your BATNA (best alternative)?

**The Opening:**

- Write your first sentence
- Practice it out loud
- Have it ready

## Common Mistakes

**The Ambush:** "We need to talk" with no context
**Better:** "Could we chat about the sprint planning process?"

**The Kitchen Sink:** Bringing up everything ever
**Better:** Focus on ONE issue at a time

**The Mind Reader:** "You obviously think..."
**Better:** "It seems like..." or "I'm perceiving..."

**The Ultimatum:** "Fix this or else"
**Better:** "Here's what I need to be successful..."

## Practice Scenarios

Start with low stakes:

1. Ask for clarification on unclear requirements
2. Suggest a process improvement
3. Give constructive feedback on documentation
4. Negotiate a deadline
5. Say no to a request

Build your confidence muscle gradually.

## The Magic Phrases

Keep these in your back pocket:

- "Help me understand..."
- "I might be wrong, but..."
- "What would success look like for you?"
- "I need some time to process this"
- "That's not going to work for me"
- "Let's find a solution together"

## Remember This

Difficult conversations are like debugging - the anticipation is worse than the reality. Most people are reasonable when approached with respect and genuine intent to solve problems.

You don't need to be perfect. You just need to be honest, respectful, and clear about what you need.

The cost of avoiding difficult conversations is always higher than having them.

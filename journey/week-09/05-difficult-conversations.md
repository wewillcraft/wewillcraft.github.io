# Difficult Conversations Framework

**Time:** 90 minutes
**Purpose:** Build confidence in handling challenging professional conversations

## Why We Avoid Difficult Conversations

- Fear of conflict
- Worry about relationships
- Uncertainty about outcomes
- Past negative experiences
- Cultural conditioning

The cost of avoidance is always higher than the discomfort of the conversation.

## Part 1: Preparation Framework (30 minutes)

### The CARE Method

**C**larify your objective
**A**ssess the situation
**R**ehearse key points
**E**xpect various outcomes

### Pre-Conversation Worksheet

**The Issue:**
What specifically needs to be addressed?

**My Goal:**
What outcome am I seeking?

**Their Perspective:**
What might they be thinking/feeling?

**Common Ground:**
Where do we align?

**Non-Negotiables:**
What boundaries must I maintain?

**Best Case:**
What's the ideal outcome?

**Worst Case:**
What's my backup plan?

## Part 2: Conversation Structure (30 minutes)

### Opening Strong

**Formula:** Context + Issue + Impact + Question

"I wanted to talk about [context]. I've noticed [specific issue], and it's affecting [impact]. Can we discuss how to address this?"

### The Discussion Flow

1. **State the issue** (30 seconds)
2. **Share your perspective** (2 minutes)
3. **Ask for their view** ("Help me understand...")
4. **Listen actively** (Really listen)
5. **Find common ground** ("We both want...")
6. **Propose solutions** ("What if we...")
7. **Agree on next steps** ("So we'll...")

### Personality-Based Approaches

**With Thinkers (T types):**

- Lead with logic and data
- Focus on problem-solving
- Keep emotions minimal

**With Feelers (F types):**

- Acknowledge emotions
- Express care for relationship
- Find win-win solutions

## Part 3: Managing Emotions (15 minutes)

### Your Emotional Toolkit

**Before:**

- Breathe deeply (4-7-8 technique)
- Power pose for 2 minutes
- Visualize success

**During:**

- Pause when triggered
- Name emotions internally
- Return to objective

**After:**

- Decompress alone
- Journal insights
- Plan follow-up

### De-escalation Techniques

When things heat up:

1. **Lower your voice** (they'll match)
2. **Acknowledge emotions** ("I see this is frustrating")
3. **Take a break** ("Let's pause for 5 minutes")
4. **Return to common goal** ("We both want...")
5. **Suggest alternative** ("What if we try...")

## Part 4: Specific Scenarios (15 minutes)

### Asking for a Raise

"Based on my contributions including [specifics], market research showing [data], and my expanded responsibilities in [areas], I'd like to discuss adjusting my compensation to [amount]."

### Addressing Poor Performance

"I've noticed [specific behavior] happening [frequency]. This impacts [consequence]. What's your perspective on this, and how can we improve the situation?"

### Disagreeing with Manager

"I appreciate your perspective on [topic]. I have a different view based on [reasoning]. Could we explore [alternative approach]?"

### Setting Boundaries

"I value our work together, and to maintain quality, I need to [specific boundary]. This will help me [positive outcome]."

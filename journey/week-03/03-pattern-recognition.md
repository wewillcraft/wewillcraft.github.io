# Pattern Recognition

**Time:** 60 minutes
**Purpose:** Transform your tracking data into actionable insights about your energy patterns

## Your Energy Data Analysis

After 7 days of tracking, you have ~100+ data points. Time to find the gold.

## Part 1: The Energy Curves (15 minutes)

### Plot Your Average Day

Draw your typical energy curves:

```
Energy Level (1-10)
10 |
9  |
8  |
7  |
6  |
5  |
4  |
3  |
2  |
1  |_________________________________
   6am 8am 10am 12pm 2pm 4pm 6pm 8pm

Physical:    Draw in RED
Mental:      Draw in BLUE
Emotional:   Draw in GREEN
Spiritual:   Draw in PURPLE
```

### Identify Your Windows

## Part 3: Context Switch Costs (10 minutes)

### Calculate Your Switch Tax

From your data, what's the average energy cost of:

| Switch Type          | Mental Cost    | Recovery Time | Frequency/Day |

| Coding → Meeting     | -\_\_\_ points | \_\_\_ min    | \_\_\_ times  |
| Meeting → Coding     | -\_\_\_ points | \_\_\_ min    | \_\_\_ times  |
| Deep Work → Slack    | -\_\_\_ points | \_\_\_ min    | \_\_\_ times  |
| Focus → Interruption | -\_\_\_ points | \_\_\_ min    | \_\_\_ times  |
| Task A → Task B      | -\_\_\_ points | \_\_\_ min    | \_\_\_ times  |

**Total daily switching cost:** **\_** energy points
**Total daily recovery time:** **\_** minutes

### Your Optimal Block Size

Based on your data:

- **Minimum focus block needed:** **\_** minutes
- **Optimal focus block:** **\_** minutes

### Rule 1: Protect Peak Hours

**"Between **_ and _**, I will **\_** because that's when **\_**"**

### Rule 2: Manage Danger Zones

**"Between **_ and _**, I will avoid **\_** because **\_**"**

### Rule 3: Strategic Recovery

**"When I notice **\_**, I will **\_** for \_\_\_ minutes"**

### Rule 4: Energy Investment

**"I will only do **\_** when my **\_** energy is above \_\_\_"**

### Rule 5: Pattern Preservation

**"To maintain high energy, I will always **\_**"**

## The Pattern Recognition Takeaway

Your energy patterns are as unique as your fingerprint.

What works for others might drain you.
What drains others might energize you.

Now you have data, not opinions.
Use it to design your optimal day.

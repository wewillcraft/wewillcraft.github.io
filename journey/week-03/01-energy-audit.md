# Energy Audit Setup

**Time:** 30 minutes\
**Purpose:** Build a system to track and understand your four types of energy

## The Energy Management Revolution

Time management is dead. Here's why:

- **You can't create more time** (everyone gets 24 hours)
- **You can't save time** (unused hours don't roll over)
- **You can't manage time** (it passes regardless)

But you CAN manage energy. And energy, unlike time, is:

- **Renewable** (with the right practices)
- **Expandable** (through training)
- **Optimizable** (through understanding)

## The Four Energy Types

### 1. Physical Energy

**The Foundation**

- **Fueled by:** Sleep, nutrition, exercise, breaks
- **Depleted by:** Poor sleep, skipped meals, sedentary work
- **Developer impact:** Can't code when exhausted
- **Quick wins:** Stand every hour, hydrate, snack smart

### 2. Mental Energy

**The Processor**

- **Fueled by:** Focus time, clarity, single-tasking
- **Depleted by:** Context switching, meetings, multitasking
- **Developer impact:** Complex problems become impossible
- **Quick wins:** Time-box tasks, batch similar work

### 3. Emotional Energy

**The Driver**

- **Fueled by:** Positive interactions, wins, meaning
- **Depleted by:** Conflict, criticism, isolation
- **Developer impact:** Affects motivation and resilience
- **Quick wins:** Celebrate small wins, connect with team

### 4. Spiritual Energy

**The Compass**

- **Fueled by:** Purpose, values alignment, impact
- **Depleted by:** Meaningless tasks, ethical conflicts
- **Developer impact:** Determines long-term sustainability
- **Quick wins:** Connect code to impact, choose meaningful projects

## Your Energy Tracking System

### Option 1: Simple Spreadsheet

Create columns for:

```
| Time | Physical (1-10) | Mental (1-10) | Emotional (1-10) | Activity | Notes |
|------|-----------------|---------------|------------------|----------|-------|
| 9am  | 8               | 9             | 7                | Coding   | Fresh |
| 10am | 7               | 8             | 7                | Coding   | Flow  |
| 11am | 6               | 6             | 5                | Meeting  | Drain |
```

### Option 2: Energy Journal

Every 2 hours, write:

```
11am Check-in:
- Physical: 7/10 (need water)
- Mental: 5/10 (post-meeting fog)
- Emotional: 6/10 (frustrated with blocker)
- Activity: Debugging auth issue
- Energy shift: Meeting → coding = -3 mental
```

### Option 3: App Tracking

Use tools like:

- **Toggl** + custom tags for energy
- **Notion** database with energy fields
- **Simple phone reminders** + notes

## Energy Indicators

### High Energy Signs

**Physical:**

- Sitting comfortably
- Alert and awake
- Ready to move

**Mental:**

- Clear thinking
- Easy focus
- Quick connections

**Emotional:**

- Motivated
- Resilient
- Positive

**Spiritual:**

- Sense of purpose
- Aligned actions
- Feeling valuable

### Low Energy Warning Signs

**Physical:**

- Slouching
- Heavy eyes
- Restlessness

**Mental:**

- Foggy thinking
- Can't focus
- Simple tasks feel hard

**Emotional:**

- Irritable
- Overwhelmed
- Withdrawn

**Spiritual:**

- "Why am I doing this?"
- Going through motions
- Feeling pointless

## Your Tracking Protocol

### Morning Setup (2 minutes)

1. **Rate your starting energy** (all 4 types)
2. **Predict your peak hours** based on how you feel
3. **Note any energy debts** (poor sleep, stress)

### Hourly Check-ins (30 seconds)

Quick rating 1-10 for each energy type
Just numbers, no analysis yet

### Activity Transitions (1 minute)

When switching tasks, note:

- Energy before transition
- Energy after transition
- What caused the shift?

### Evening Review (5 minutes)

1. **Graph your energy curves**
2. **Identify patterns**
3. **Note surprises**

## Common Developer Energy Patterns

### The Morning Surge

- High mental energy 9-11am
- Best for: Architecture, complex problems
- Protect this time ruthlessly

### The Post-Lunch Dip

- Low physical energy 1-3pm
- Best for: Admin, easy tasks, code reviews
- Never schedule important decisions

### The Second Wind

- Energy revival 3-5pm or evening
- Best for: Creative work, side projects
- Varies by chronotype

### The Context Switch Crash

- -2 mental energy per interruption
- Recovery time: 15-25 minutes
- Batch similar tasks together

## This Week's Tracking Goals

### Minimum Viable Tracking

- **Check in 3x daily** (morning, lunch, evening)
- **Rate all 4 energies** (1-10 scale)
- **Note current activity**

### Optimal Tracking

- **Hourly check-ins** during work
- **Transition notes** between tasks
- **Energy impact** of specific activities

### Advanced Tracking

- **Minute-by-minute** during peak/crash
- **Correlation data** (sleep, food, exercise)
- **Environmental factors** (noise, temperature, light)

## Tracking Tips

### Make It Frictionless

- Set phone reminders
- Keep tracker visible
- Use simplest method that works

### Track Honestly

- No judgment, just data
- Include the crashes
- Note when you skip tracking (that's data too)

### Focus on Patterns, Not Points

- Single bad hours don't matter
- Weekly patterns do
- Look for consistent triggers

## Preparing for Analysis

After 7 days, you'll analyze:

1. **Peak windows** (when you're unstoppable)
2. **Danger zones** (when you crash)
3. **Energy vampires** (what consistently drains you)
4. **Energy boosters** (what refuels you)
5. **Transition costs** (switching between activities)

## Your Energy Hypothesis

Before you start tracking, predict:

**I think my peak [physical/mental/emotional] energy is at:** **\_\_\_\_**

**I think **\_\_\_\_** gives me energy**

**I think **\_\_\_\_** drains my energy**

**I'm most productive when:** **\_\_\_\_**

**I crash when:** **\_\_\_\_**

Save these predictions. We'll compare them to your actual data next week.

## The Energy Audit Commitment

For the next 7 days, I commit to:

- [ ] Tracking my energy at least 3x daily
- [ ] Rating all 4 energy types
- [ ] Noting my activities
- [ ] Tracking honestly, even the bad days
- [ ] Not trying to "fix" anything yet (just observe)

## Remember

You're not broken. You're not lazy. You just haven't understood your energy patterns yet.

This week, we stop forcing ourselves into arbitrary schedules and start designing around our natural rhythms.

Data first. Optimization later.

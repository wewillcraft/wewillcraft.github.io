## Hey friend! ðŸ‘‹

Today we're starting a week-long experiment to understand your unique energy patterns. Think of yourself as a scientist studying the most interesting subject: YOU!

## Today's Big Idea ðŸ’¡

**Energy is more valuable than time.** You can have all the time in the world, but if you don't have energy, you can't do anything meaningful with it. When you understand your energy patterns, you can work WITH them instead of against them.

## Why This Matters

Most people try to force themselves to work at random times and then wonder why everything feels so hard. When you understand your energy rhythms:

- You schedule hard tasks during peak energy
- You protect your recharge time
- You stop feeling guilty about natural low periods
- Everything becomes easier

## Your 15-Minute Mission

### Step 1: Energy Check-In (5 minutes)

Right now, rate your energy in each area (1-10):

**Physical:** How does your body feel? (tired, energized, etc.)
**Mental:** How sharp is your thinking? (foggy, focused, etc.)
**Emotional:** How do you feel inside? (stressed, happy, etc.)
**Motivational:** How driven do you feel? (inspired, flat, etc.)

### Step 2: Set Up Simple Tracking (10 minutes)

For the next week, check in with yourself 3 times a day (maybe 9am, 2pm, 8pm) and note:

- Your energy levels (1-10 in each type)
- What you were doing
- How you're feeling

Use whatever works - phone notes, a simple notepad, or any app you like.

## Quick Win âœ…

**Right now:** Set 3 daily reminders on your phone for energy check-ins. This simple act will give you incredible insights by week's end!

## The Four Types of Energy

**Physical Energy:** Your body's fuel

- High: Ready for action, alert, comfortable
- Low: Tired, sluggish, need rest

**Mental Energy:** Your brain's processing power

- High: Sharp thinking, clear focus, can tackle complex problems
- Low: Foggy, distracted, making simple mistakes

**Emotional Energy:** Your inner state

- High: Positive, resilient, excited
- Low: Stressed, anxious, overwhelmed

**Motivational Energy:** Your drive to take action

- High: Eager to work, inspired, purposeful
- Low: Unmotivated, flat, going through the motions

## Real Talk

You don't need perfect energy in all areas to do good work. Sometimes you'll have high mental energy but low physical energy - that's perfect for planning or learning. Other times you'll have high physical energy but low mental energy - great for organizing or simple tasks.

The goal isn't to optimize everything perfectly. It's to understand your patterns so you can work with them.

## Today's Takeaway

You're not a machine that runs at constant speed. You're a dynamic system with natural rhythms. This week, you're going to discover those rhythms and learn to honor them. ðŸŽ¯

- **Developer impact:** Affects motivation and resilience
- **Quick wins:** Celebrate small wins, connect with team

### 4. Spiritual Energy

**The Compass**

- **Fueled by:** Purpose, values alignment, impact
- **Depleted by:** Meaningless tasks, ethical conflicts
- **Developer impact:** Determines long-term sustainability
- **Quick wins:** Connect code to impact, choose meaningful projects

## Your Energy Tracking System

### Option 1: Simple Spreadsheet

Create columns for:

```
| Time | Physical (1-10) | Mental (1-10) | Emotional (1-10) | Activity | Notes |
|------|-----------------|---------------|------------------|----------|-------|
| 9am  | 8               | 9             | 7                | Coding   | Fresh |
| 10am | 7               | 8             | 7                | Coding   | Flow  |
| 11am | 6               | 6             | 5                | Meeting  | Drain |
```

### Option 2: Energy Journal

Every 2 hours, write:

```
11am Check-in:
- Physical: 7/10 (need water)
- Mental: 5/10 (post-meeting fog)
- Emotional: 6/10 (frustrated with blocker)
- Activity: Debugging auth issue
- Energy shift: Meeting â†’ coding = -3 mental
```

### Option 3: App Tracking

Use tools like:

- **Toggl** + custom tags for energy
- **Notion** database with energy fields
- **Simple phone reminders** + notes

## Energy Indicators

## Your Tracking Protocol

### Morning Setup (2 minutes)

1. **Rate your starting energy** (all 4 types)
2. **Predict your peak hours** based on how you feel
3. **Note any energy debts** (poor sleep, stress)

### Hourly Check-ins (30 seconds)

Quick rating 1-10 for each energy type
Just numbers, no analysis yet

### Activity Transitions (1 minute)

When switching tasks, note:

- Energy before transition
- Energy after transition
- What caused the shift?

### Evening Review (5 minutes)

1. **Graph your energy curves**
2. **Identify patterns**
3. **Note surprises**

## Common Developer Energy Patterns

### The Morning Surge

- High mental energy 9-11am
- Best for: Architecture, complex problems
- Protect this time ruthlessly

### The Post-Lunch Dip

- Low physical energy 1-3pm
- Best for: Admin, easy tasks, code reviews
- Never schedule important decisions

### The Second Wind

- Energy revival 3-5pm or evening
- Best for: Creative work, side projects
- Varies by chronotype

### The Context Switch Crash

- -2 mental energy per interruption
- Recovery time: 15-25 minutes
- Batch similar tasks together

## This Week's Tracking Goals

### Minimum Viable Tracking

- **Check in 3x daily** (morning, lunch, evening)
- **Rate all 4 energies** (1-10 scale)
- **Note current activity**

### Optimal Tracking

- **Hourly check-ins** during work
- **Transition notes** between tasks
- **Energy impact** of specific activities

### Advanced Tracking

- **Minute-by-minute** during peak/crash
- **Correlation data** (sleep, food, exercise)
- **Environmental factors** (noise, temperature, light)

## Tracking Tips

### Make It Frictionless

- Set phone reminders
- Keep tracker visible
- Use simplest method that works

### Track Honestly

- No judgment, just data
- Include the crashes
- Note when you skip tracking (that's data too)

### Focus on Patterns, Not Points

- Single bad hours don't matter
- Weekly patterns do
- Look for consistent triggers

## Preparing for Analysis

After 7 days, you'll analyze:

1. **Peak windows** (when you're unstoppable)
2. **Danger zones** (when you crash)
3. **Energy vampires** (what consistently drains you)
4. **Energy boosters** (what refuels you)
5. **Transition costs** (switching between activities)

## Your Energy Hypothesis

Before you start tracking, predict:

**I think my peak [physical/mental/emotional] energy is at:** **\_\_\_\_**

**I think **\_\_\_\_** gives me energy**

**I think **\_\_\_\_** drains my energy**

**I'm most productive when:** **\_\_\_\_**

**I crash when:** **\_\_\_\_**

Save these predictions. We'll compare them to your actual data next week.

## The Energy Audit Commitment

For the next 7 days, I commit to:

- [ ] Tracking my energy at least 3x daily
- [ ] Rating all 4 energy types
- [ ] Noting my activities
- [ ] Tracking honestly, even the bad days
- [ ] Not trying to "fix" anything yet (just observe)

## Remember

You're not broken. You're not lazy. You just haven't understood your energy patterns yet.

This week, we stop forcing ourselves into arbitrary schedules and start designing around our natural rhythms.

Data first. Optimization later.

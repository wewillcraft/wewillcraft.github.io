## Language Specific to Productivity

### Instead of:
- "Optimize your day" → "Find what works"
- "Maximum efficiency" → "Sustainable pace"
- "Productivity hack" → "Helpful pattern"
- "Time blocking" → "Energy matching"
- "Peak performance" → "Good enough consistently"

## Writing Style Notes

### Avoid Em Dashes
- **NO EM DASHES (—)**: They sound too AI-written
- Use shorter sentences instead
- Or use commas for quick asides
- Sometimes a colon works: like this
- Questions can break things up too. See?
- Just write like you're talking to a friend

- 70% consistently > 100% sometimes
- Done is better than perfect
- Iteration over perfection
- "Good enough is great"

### For Chaos Minds:
- Flexible structure
- Minimum viable system
- Start with one habit
- "Some structure helps"

### For Overwhelmed:
- Start tiny
- One thing at a time
- Systems reduce decisions
- "Small steps count"

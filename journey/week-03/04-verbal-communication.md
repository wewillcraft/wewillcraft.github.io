## Let's Talk About Talking üéôÔ∏è

Remember that time you had the PERFECT response... three hours after the meeting ended? Or when you practiced a presentation 50 times but still forgot everything the moment you stood up?

Welcome to being human. Let's make speaking less scary.

## Your Speaking Style

Quick check - which sounds like you?

**The Processor:** "I need a minute to think about that..."
**The Processor:** Thinks, then speaks. Quality over quantity.

**The Expresser:** "Let me think out loud here..."
**The Expresser:** Speaks to think. Quantity leads to quality.

Both are valid. Stop trying to be the other one.

## The Meeting Survival Guide

### For Standups

The magic formula: **Yesterday + in this lesson + Blockers**

```
"Yesterday I fixed the auth bug.
in this lesson I'm starting the payment integration.
No blockers, but I might need Sarah's help later."
```

30 seconds. Done. Nobody needs your life story.

### For Regular Meetings

**The PREP Method** (when you need to make a point):

- **P**oint: "We should switch to TypeScript"
- **R**eason: "It'll catch 40% of our bugs"
- **E**xample: "Last week's outage wouldn't have happened"
- **P**oint: "So let's switch to TypeScript"

**The 2-Minute Rule:** If you've been talking for 2 minutes straight, you've lost them. Pause. Check in. Let others speak.

### For Video Calls

**Camera Hacks:**

- Look at the camera, not yourself (I know it's hard)
- Put a tiny arrow pointing to your camera
- Elevate laptop to eye level (books work)
- Light source in front, not behind

**Audio Wins:**

- Headphones > speakers (always)
- Mute when not talking (be that person)
- "Can you hear me?" is a valid opener

## Presentations That Don't Suck

### The 10-20-30 Rule

- **10** slides maximum
- **20** minutes maximum
- **30** point font minimum

People came for insights, not an audiobook.

### The Story Structure

Don't present facts. Tell a story:

1. **The Problem** - "Our deploy takes 45 minutes..."
2. **The Pain** - "We're losing $X and developer sanity..."
3. **The Discovery** - "I found that if we..."
4. **The Solution** - "Here's what we can do..."
5. **The Outcome** - "In 2 weeks, deploys will take 5 minutes"

### Dealing With Nerves

**Before Speaking:**

- Power pose for 2 minutes (it actually works)
- Breathe: 4 counts in, 6 counts out
- Remember: They WANT you to succeed

**While Speaking:**

- Pause instead of "um" (silence is powerful)
- Keep water nearby
- Find three friendly faces to rotate between

**The Nuclear Option:** "I'm a bit nervous, bear with me" - instantly makes everyone root for you.

## One-on-Ones That Matter

### With Your Manager

```
Start: "Here's what's going well..."
Middle: "Here's what I need help with..."
End: "Here's what I'm planning next..."
```

### With Direct Reports

```
Start: "How are you really?"
Middle: "What obstacles can I remove?"
End: "What do you need from me?"
```

### With Peers

```
Start: "Got time for a quick sync?"
Middle: Get to the actual point
End: "What are the next steps?"
```

## Difficult Conversations

### The FORMAT Framework

- **F**acts: What actually happened
- **O**bjective: What you're trying to achieve
- **R**espect: Acknowledge their perspective
- **M**utual: Find common ground
- **A**ction: Agree on next steps
- **T**ime: Set a follow-up

### Example Script

"Hey, I wanted to talk about the code review yesterday (Facts). I'm hoping we can find a better way to give feedback (Objective). I know you're passionate about code quality (Respect), and I am too (Mutual). Could we try written comments first, then discuss? (Action). Let's check in Friday to see if it's working (Time)."

## Your Speaking Workout

**Monday:** Speak first in one meeting
**Tuesday:** Ask one clarifying question
**Wednesday:** Give one piece of positive feedback verbally
**Thursday:** Practice PREP with one point
**Friday:** Have one video call with camera on

Start small. Build confidence. Compound gains.

## Quick Confidence Boosters

1. **Record yourself** - Painful but powerful
2. **Join a random online meetup** - Low stakes practice
3. **Read out loud daily** - Yes, even to yourself
4. **Explain code verbally** - Rubber duck debugging counts
5. **Call instead of text** - Once a day

## The Introvert's Secret Weapon

**Pre-meeting prep:**

- Review agenda
- Write three points you might make
- Decide your one must-say thing
- Plan your opening sentence

You don't need to wing it. Preparation is your superpower.

## The Extrovert's Secret Weapon

**The pause practice:**

- Count to 2 before responding
- Let others finish completely
- Ask "What do you think?" more
- Summarize what others said

Your energy is amazing. Channel it strategically.

## Remember This

Good verbal communication isn't about being smooth or never stumbling. It's about being clear, being genuine, and making sure your message lands.

Everyone's nervous. Everyone says "um." Everyone forgets their point sometimes. The difference is practice and self-compassion.

Next lesson: Having difficult conversations without losing your mind (or your job).

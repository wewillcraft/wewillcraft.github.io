## The People Puzzle üß©

You know that coworker who needs EVERY detail before making a decision? And that other one who interrupts meetings with "But what if we tried something completely different?"

They're not trying to be difficult. They just have different wiring.

in this lesson, we're learning how to speak everyone's language. It's like being a polyglot, but for personalities.

## The Quick Personality Decoder

Forget complicated personality tests. Here's how to read people in 30 seconds:

### The Energy Test

Watch them in meetings:

- **Thinks out loud** = Extrovert (E)
- **Thinks then speaks** = Introvert (I)

### The Information Test

Listen to their questions:

- **"Show me the data"** = Sensor (S)
- **"What's possible?"** = Intuitive (N)

### The Decision Test

Watch how they decide:

- **"What makes logical sense?"** = Thinker (T)
- **"How will people feel?"** = Feeler (F)

### The Structure Test

Check their calendar:

- **Color-coded and planned** = Judger (J)
- **"Let's see how it goes"** = Perceiver (P)

## Common Dev Team Personalities

### The Architect (INTJ/INTP)

**You'll know them because:** They're designing systems 5 years into the future while you're still debugging yesterday's code.

**How to talk to them:**

- Skip small talk
- Bring your A-game logic
- Let them think before answering
- Email > impromptu calls

**Magic words:** "I've thought this through and..."

### The Builder (ISTP/ESTP)

**You'll know them because:** They're already coding while everyone else is still discussing.

**How to talk to them:**

- Be direct and practical
- Show, don't tell
- Focus on what works NOW
- Keep meetings short

**Magic words:** "Here's the immediate problem..."

### The Advocate (ENFJ/INFJ)

**You'll know them because:** They remember everyone's birthday and actually care about your weekend.

**How to talk to them:**

- Start with connection
- Consider team impact
- Acknowledge feelings
- Be genuine (they can smell fake)

**Magic words:** "I value your perspective on this..."

### The Innovator (ENTP/ENFP)

**You'll know them because:** Every standup becomes a brainstorming session.

**How to talk to them:**

- Be open to tangents
- Connect to the big picture
- Embrace "what if" discussions
- Don't kill their enthusiasm

**Magic words:** "That's interesting, tell me more..."

## The Adaptation Cheat Sheet

### Talking to Introverts

```
DO: Send agenda ahead, give processing time, use chat
DON'T: Put them on the spot, demand instant answers
```

### Talking to Extroverts

```
DO: Let them process verbally, brainstorm together, hop on calls
DON'T: Expect them to figure it out alone
```

### Talking to Sensors

```
DO: Provide examples, be specific, show proven results
DON'T: Be vague, skip steps, oversell the vision
```

### Talking to Intuitives

```
DO: Start with why, paint the vision, discuss possibilities
DON'T: Drown them in details, dismiss new ideas
```

### Talking to Thinkers

```
DO: Use data, be logical, focus on efficiency
DON'T: Take criticism personally, use only emotional appeals
```

### Talking to Feelers

```
DO: Consider people impact, show appreciation, be warm
DON'T: Be coldly logical, ignore team morale
```

## Real Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Code Review with ISTJ Lead

**Wrong way:** "I tried something creative here!"
**Right way:** "I followed the pattern from module X, with one optimization based on benchmark data..."

### Scenario 2: Brainstorm with ENFP Designer

**Wrong way:** "That won't work because of technical constraints."
**Right way:** "I love that energy! Let's explore what's possible and then figure out the technical path..."

### Scenario 3: Update to INTJ Manager

**Wrong way:** Long story about the journey
**Right way:** "Result: X. Method: Y. Next step: Z. Questions?"

## The Personality Clash Solver

When two types collide:

**Detail-Lover vs Big-Picture Thinker**

- Meet in the middle: Start with vision, then zoom into details
- Use the sandwich: Big picture ‚Üí Details ‚Üí Big picture

**Fast Mover vs Careful Planner**

- Agree on MVP: What must be perfect vs what can iterate
- Time-box decisions: "Let's decide by Friday"

**People-First vs Task-First**

- Both matter: "To achieve X goal, we need the team to feel Y"
- Take turns leading: Task discussion, then people check-in

## Your Personality Communication Map

Fill this out for your team:

**Person: ________________**

- Their type (guess): ____
- They need: ____________
- I should: _____________
- Avoid: _______________

**Person: ________________**

- Their type (guess): ____
- They need: ____________
- I should: _____________
- Avoid: _______________

## The Flex Practice

This week, try the **Personality Mirror Challenge**:

**Monday:** Match an introvert's communication style
**Tuesday:** Match an extrovert's energy
**Wednesday:** Speak sensor (all details, no vision)
**Thursday:** Go full intuitive (all vision, minimal details)
**Friday:** Balance both thinking and feeling in decisions

## Quick Personality Hacks

**Universal tips that work with everyone:**

1. **Ask how they prefer to communicate** (revolutionary, I know)
2. **Watch what energizes vs drains them**
3. **Notice their decision-making speed**
4. **Pay attention to their questions**
5. **Remember: Preference ‚â† Ability**

## The Plot Twist

Here's the thing nobody mentions: **People are inconsistent.**

Your introverted manager might be extroverted about their favorite project. Your logical architect might get emotional about code quality. Your detail-oriented QA might dream big about testing innovation.

Personality types are starting points, not prison cells.

## Remember This

The goal isn't to manipulate or fake it. It's to remove friction from communication. When you speak someone's language, you're not changing your message‚Äîyou're just making sure it lands.

Think of it like responsive design, but for humans. Same content, different presentation based on the user's needs.

Next lesson, we'll tackle written communication‚Äîemails, docs, and the art of the perfect Slack message.

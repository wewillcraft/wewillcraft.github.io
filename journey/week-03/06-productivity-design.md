# Personality-Based Productivity Design

**Time:** 90 minutes
**Purpose:** Design a productivity system that works with your nature, not against it

## Stop Using Someone Else's System

The reason productivity systems fail isn't you—it's the mismatch.

- **Introverts** using extrovert systems
- **Night owls** forcing morning routines
- **Creatives** using rigid structures
- **Analyticals** using vague methods
- **Sprinters** trying to marathon

Time to build YOUR system.

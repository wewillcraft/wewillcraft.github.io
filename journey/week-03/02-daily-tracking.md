# Daily Energy Tracking

**Time:** 15 minutes per day × 7 days\
**Purpose:** Collect real data about your energy patterns to design your optimal schedule

## Today's Mission

Track your energy every hour. Simple as that.

No analysis. No optimization. Just honest observation.

## Your Daily Tracking Template

## Daily Patterns to Watch

### The Startup Sequence

How long does it take to reach peak mental energy?

- [ ] Immediate (< 30 min)
- [ ] Quick warm-up (30-60 min)
- [ ] Slow build (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Never quite gets there

### The Flow Windows

When do you enter flow state?

- [ ] Early morning (6-9am)
- [ ] Morning (9-12pm)
- [ ] Early afternoon (12-3pm)
- [ ] Late afternoon (3-6pm)
- [ ] Evening (6-9pm)
- [ ] Night (9pm+)

### The Crash Points

When does energy consistently drop?

- [ ] Mid-morning (10-11am)
- [ ] Pre-lunch (11am-12pm)
- [ ] Post-lunch (1-3pm)
- [ ] Mid-afternoon (3-4pm)
- [ ] Late afternoon (4-5pm)
- [ ] Evening (5-7pm)

### The Recovery Methods

What actually restores your energy?

**Physical Recovery:**

- [ ] Walk
- [ ] Snack
- [ ] Water
- [ ] Stretch
- [ ] Power nap
- [ ] Exercise

**Mental Recovery:**

- [ ] Complete break
- [ ] Different task type
- [ ] Mindless task
- [ ] Music
- [ ] Silence
- [ ] Change location

**Emotional Recovery:**

- [ ] Chat with colleague
- [ ] Solo time
- [ ] Win something small
- [ ] Help someone
- [ ] Laugh
- [ ] Complain (yes, really)

## Energy Experiments

Each day, test ONE thing:

### Day 1: Baseline

Just track normally, no changes

### Day 2: Morning Routine

Try starting 30 min earlier or later

### Day 3: Break Patterns

Take breaks every 45 min vs. 90 min

### Day 4: Task Order

Do hardest task first vs. warming up

### Day 5: Environment

Work from different location/setup

### Day 6: Social Energy

More solo time vs. more interaction

### Day 7: Full Design

Try your hypothetical "perfect" day

## Quick Tracking Hacks

### The Sticky Note Method

Four sticky notes on monitor:

- P: [current physical score]
- M: [current mental score]
- E: [current emotional score]
- S: [current spiritual score]

Update hourly, photograph at day end

### The Emoji Method

Use emojis in your calendar:

- 🔥 = High energy (8-10)
- ✅ = Good energy (6-7)
- 😐 = Medium energy (4-5)
- 😫 = Low energy (2-3)
- 💀 = Crashed (0-1)

### The Color Code Method

In your journal/tracker:

- **Green** = Optimal energy
- **Yellow** = Functional energy
- **Red** = Depleted energy

## Common Tracking Mistakes

### Don't Do This:

- Track only when feeling good
- Judge your patterns
- Try to have "perfect" days
- Change everything at once
- Track retrospectively (memory lies)

### Do This Instead:

- Track especially when struggling
- Observe without judgment
- Accept your natural patterns
- Change nothing this week
- Track in the moment

## Energy Tracking Mantras

**"I'm collecting data, not judging myself"**

**"Bad energy days are valuable data"**

**"Patterns matter more than points"**

**"My energy is information, not evaluation"**

## Special Situations

### The All-Nighter Recovery

If you pull an all-nighter:

- Track every 30 minutes
- Note the stages of degradation
- Track recovery time needed
- Document the true cost

### The Crisis Mode

During production issues:

- Quick rating only (P/M/E/S numbers)
- Track adrenaline separately
- Note the crash after
- Measure recovery time

### The Perfect Day

When everything clicks:

- Track every 30 minutes
- Note EVERYTHING (food, sleep, weather, tasks)
- Try to replicate next day
- Document what made it special

## Weekly Checkpoint Questions

After each day, quickly answer:

1. **What surprised me about my energy today?**
2. **When did I feel most alive?**
3. **What drained me unnecessarily?**
4. **What pattern am I starting to see?**

## Your Daily Tracking Commitment

Each day this week:

- [ ] Morning energy check (2 min)
- [ ] Minimum 3 hourly checks (30 sec each)
- [ ] Evening review (3 min)
- [ ] Note one surprise
- [ ] No optimization (just observation)

## Remember

You're a scientist this week, not a judge.

Every energy crash is valuable data.
Every energy peak is a clue.
Every pattern is information.

Track honestly. The data will set you free.

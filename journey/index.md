# The 100-Day Journey

**Discover Your Foundation → Build Your Systems → Create Your Impact**

A 14-week transformation program designed for college students and early-career
professionals ready to build not just great skills, but a meaningful life.
Master self-knowledge, create sustainable systems, and develop the influence to
make your mark.

## Overview

- **Duration:** 14 weeks (100 days)
- **Daily Commitment:** 20-30 minutes
- **Format:** Self-paced with weekly themes

## Core Philosophy

True growth happens in layers. You can't build sustainable success without
understanding yourself first. This journey guides you through three essential
phases: discovering who you are, building systems that work for you, and
creating meaningful impact in your world.

## The Three Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-5)

_"Who am I and how do I grow?"_

Build your personal foundation through self-discovery, learning optimization,
communication skills, community building, and resilience development.

### Phase 2: Systems (Weeks 6-10)

_"How do I create sustainable success?"_

Design personal systems for purpose-driven work, sustainable productivity, deep
focus, healthy boundaries, and work-life integration.

### Phase 3: Impact (Weeks 11-14)

_"How do I contribute and lead?"_

Develop your capacity for career strategy, leadership influence, meaningful
contribution, and future planning.

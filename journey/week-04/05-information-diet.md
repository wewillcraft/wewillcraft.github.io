# Information Diet Design

**Time:** 90 minutes  
**Purpose:** Create a systematic approach to consuming technical information that accelerates learning without causing overwhelm

## The Information Overload Crisis

As developers, we face an unprecedented challenge: the half-life of technical knowledge is shrinking while the volume of new information explodes exponentially.

**The numbers are staggering:**
- **500+ new JavaScript packages** published daily to npm
- **10,000+ programming articles** published daily across all platforms  
- **100+ hours** of tech content uploaded to YouTube every minute
- **20+ major framework updates** released weekly across all ecosystems

**The result?** Analysis paralysis, FOMO, superficial understanding, and constant anxiety about falling behind.

An information diet isn't about consuming less - it's about consuming smarter. Like physical nutrition, information nutrition requires intentional choices about quality, timing, and variety.

## Part 1: Information Audit & Assessment (25 minutes)

### The SQRW Method for Technical Content

Adapted from academic reading strategies for technical material:

#### S - Survey (2-3 minutes)
- Scan headings, subheadings, and code examples
- Read introduction and conclusion
- Identify key concepts and difficulty level
- Decide: Skip, Skim, or Study

#### Q - Question (1-2 minutes)  
- Generate questions based on headings
- Connect to existing knowledge gaps
- Set specific learning objectives

#### R - Read (15-45 minutes)
- Read actively with questions in mind
- Take notes in your second brain
- Test understanding with examples
- Mark concepts for spaced repetition

#### W - Write (5-10 minutes)
- Summarize key insights
- Connect to existing knowledge
- Identify action items
- Create implementation notes

### Speed Reading for Technical Content

Traditional speed reading doesn't work for code and complex concepts, but these techniques help:

#### Layered Reading Strategy

**Layer 1: Structure Scan** (2 minutes)
- Identify article type (tutorial, concept explanation, news)
- Scan for code examples and diagrams
- Note section structure and flow

**Layer 2: Conceptual Reading** (10-15 minutes)
- Focus on explanations and principles
- Skip implementation details initially
- Build mental model of the topic

**Layer 3: Implementation Reading** (20-30 minutes)
- Dive into code examples
- Work through exercises
- Test understanding with variations

#### Strategic Skipping

**Skip these sections:**
- Author biography unless directly relevant
- Excessive background that you already know
- Tangential examples that don't add understanding
- Promotional content within articles

**Never skip these sections:**
- Code examples and their explanations
- Error messages and troubleshooting
- Performance implications
- Security considerations

### The Feeder-Reader-Leader Strategy

## The Coder's Health Reality Check

Your current health situation:

- Haven't seen sunlight in 3 days
- Back hurts from your "gaming chair"
- Eyes burning from screen time
- Living on energy drinks and hope
- "I'll exercise when I have time" (narrator: they never had time)

Sound familiar? Your body is keeping score, even if you're ignoring it.

## Mental Health IS Health

Let's start with what nobody talks about:

### The Tech Mental Health Challenges

- Imposter syndrome eating you alive
- Anxiety about keeping up with new tech
- Depression from comparing yourself to Twitter devs
- Burnout from the constant learning
- Loneliness from remote work/studying

**This is normal. You're not broken. You're human in a demanding field.**

If anything is below 5 for more than a week, get help. Seriously.

## Sleep: Your Secret Weapon

Hustle culture is lying to you. Sleep isn't for the weak. It's for people who
want to:

- Actually remember what they learn
- Debug without crying
- Have good ideas
- Not hate everyone
- Live past 40

### The Sleep Reality

**You need:** 7-9 hours\
**You're getting:** 4-6 hours\
**The gap:** Your sanity

### The Coder's Sleep Protocol

**10 PM:** Screens to night mode **11 PM:** Close the laptop (yes, really)
**11:30 PM:** Phone across room **12 AM:** Actually in bed **7-8 AM:** Wake up
like a human

**Can't sleep? Try:**

- Blue light blockers ($15 on Amazon)
- White noise (free apps)
- Melatonin (ask pharmacist)
- Actually being tired (novel concept)

## Desk Job Survival Guide

You're slowly dying at your desk. Here's how to die slower:

### The Every-Hour Protocol

Set a timer. Every hour:

1. Stand up (30 seconds)
2. Walk somewhere (1 minute)
3. Look at something far away (30 seconds)
4. Stretch your wrists (30 seconds)
5. Drink water (ongoing)

That's it. 2 minutes to not become a pretzel.

### The Posture Reality Check

**Your setup right now:**

- Laptop on lap/bed
- Hunched like a question mark
- Neck at 90-degree angle
- Wrists bent weird
- Back unsupported

**The free fixes:**

- Stack books under laptop (eye level)
- Rolled towel behind lower back
- Feet flat on floor (or box)
- External keyboard if possible ($20)
- Phone breaks every 20 minutes

## Exercise for People Who Hate Exercise

You don't need a gym. You need to move your body.

### The No-Equipment, No-Excuse Workout

**Morning (5 minutes):**

- 10 jumping jacks

- Take stairs if available
- Do desk stretches
- Walk while on calls

**Evening (10 minutes):**

- Can't sleep for days
- Any pain lasting >2 weeks

Your school health center is usually free or cheap. Use it.

## Remember This

Your health is not negotiable. Your career means nothing if you're too sick,
tired, or depressed to enjoy it.

Every tech bro tweeting about their 100-hour weeks is either lying or heading
for burnout. The ones with sustainable careers? They sleep. They exercise. They
eat vegetables sometimes. They have therapists.

You can't debug your way out of health problems. You can't optimize your way out
of exhaustion. You can't hustle your way out of human needs.

Your body is the hardware. Your mind is the OS. If either crashes, nothing else
matters.

Take care of yourself. Not tomorrow. Not after this project. Now. Even if it's
just drinking a glass of water and standing up.

That's still better than nothing. And you deserve better than nothing. 💪

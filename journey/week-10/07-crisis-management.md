**Vibe:** Your emergency resilience toolkit ðŸ§°

Sometimes life doesn't just knock - it kicks down the door. Job loss, health scares, relationship endings, family crises... we all face moments when everything feels like it's falling apart. This isn't about preventing crises (some are inevitable) - it's about having a plan when they hit.

## What Counts as a Crisis?

A crisis is any situation that:

- Threatens your wellbeing, security, or values
- Feels overwhelming or beyond your current coping skills
- Disrupts your normal life significantly
- Creates intense emotional distress
- Requires immediate attention or decision-making

â–¡ Health emergency (you or loved one)

## After the Crisis

Once the immediate crisis passes:
â–¡ Process what happened with someone you trust
â–¡ Notice what coping strategies worked
â–¡ Update your crisis plan based on what you learned
â–¡ Take care of any relationships that carried you through
â–¡ Be patient with yourself during recovery

## Remember This

You are stronger than you know. Even when everything feels like it's falling apart, your ability to read this right now proves you're still here, still fighting, still growing.

Crisis often brings out capabilities you didn't know you had. It also shows you who your real support system is. Both of these are gifts, even wrapped in difficulty.

You've got this - and if you don't feel like you do in this lesson, that's okay too. Each new day brings fresh possibilities. ðŸ’™

## Key Takeaways

**Recovery is not optional.** It's a performance strategy, not a luxury. Regular recovery prevents burnout and enhances long-term effectiveness.

**One size does not fit all.** Your recovery needs are unique to your personality, work style, and life situation. What works for others may not work for you.

**Recovery is a skill.** Like any skill, it improves with practice and intentional development. Start small and build up your recovery repertoire.

**Recovery compounds.** Good recovery habits create positive spirals—you recover better, perform better, and need less recovery over time.

**Emergency recovery is not enough.** While it's good to have quick fixes, preventive recovery is far more effective than crisis recovery.

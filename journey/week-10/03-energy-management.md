# Energy Management

**Time:** 90 minutes  
**Purpose:** Map your energy patterns and build systems for sustainable peak performance

## The Energy Revolution

Time management is dead. Energy management is the future. You can't create more hours in the day, but you can dramatically improve your energy quality and allocation.

## Part 1: Understanding Your Energy Types (25 minutes)

### The Four Types of Energy

**Physical Energy**
- Body's capacity for activity
- Influenced by sleep, nutrition, exercise, recovery
- Foundation for all other energy types
- Most obvious and measurable

**Emotional Energy**  
- Your mood, feelings, and emotional resilience
- Affected by relationships, stress, fulfillment
- Can energize or drain dramatically
- Often overlooked but crucial

**Mental Energy**
- Cognitive capacity for focus and decision-making
- Limited daily supply (decision fatigue is real)
- Quality varies throughout the day
- Essential for complex work

**Spiritual Energy**
- Sense of purpose, meaning, and connection
- Driven by values alignment and contribution
- Can sustain you through physical exhaustion
- Most renewable when aligned

### Your Energy Audit

Rate your current levels (1-10) at this moment:

**Physical Energy:** ___

## Key Takeaways

**Energy is your most valuable resource.** Unlike time, energy quality varies dramatically. Managing energy well multiplies your effectiveness.

**Everyone has a unique energy profile.** Your patterns are different from others. What energizes you might drain someone else.

**Energy compounds.** Good energy management creates an upward spiral. Poor energy management creates a downward spiral.

**Recovery is not optional.** You can't manage energy without planning for energy restoration.

**Small changes, big impact.** Minor adjustments to energy patterns can dramatically improve performance and satisfaction.

## Let's Get Real About Money

Your financial situation right now:

- Living on ramen and hope
- Student loans lurking in the shadows
- Credit card you probably shouldn't have gotten
- Side hustle that pays for coffee
- Dreams bigger than your bank account

And that's okay. Everyone starts somewhere. Most of us start broke.

## The Shame-Free Money Audit

No judgment. Just facts. Where are you really?

### Current Reality Check

**Monthly money in:**

- Part-time job: $___

If it's negative, you're not alone. If it's positive, you're ahead of most.

## The Student Budget Reality

### The Ramen Tier ($0-500/month)

You're surviving on:

- Instant noodles and free pizza at events
- Parents' Netflix password
- Walking everywhere
- Library for AC/heat
- Free campus activities

**Survival strategies:**

- Food banks exist and they're for you
- Campus jobs often include meals
- Textbook PDFs aren't stealing, they're surviving
- Every free event with food is a dinner plan

### The PB&J Tier ($500-1000/month)

You've upgraded to:

- Actual groceries sometimes
- Your own Spotify
- Occasional Uber
- Coffee that's not instant
- A night out once a month

**Optimization strategies:**

- Meal prep Sundays save money and time
- Student discounts on EVERYTHING
- Split subscriptions with friends
- Happy hours and student nights

### The "I Have a Part-Time Job" Tier ($1000-2000/month)

You can afford:

- Gas for your car
- Occasional new clothes
- Small emergency fund

**Growth strategies:**

- Start that $100 emergency fund
- Automate $25/month savings
- Track spending for one month
- Consider a secured credit card

## The Debt Reality (Without the Drama)

### Student Loans: The Elephant

**Federal loans:** Generally okay debt (low interest, flexible repayment)
**Private loans:** Higher priority to pay off **Parent PLUS loans:** Talk to
your parents now

**The strategy:**

- Know your total (scary but necessary)
- Understand your grace period
- Research income-driven repayment
- Don't panic about them yet

### Credit Card Debt: The Trap

**If you have it:** You're not stupid, you were surviving

**The escape plan:**

1. Stop using the card
2. Pay minimum on all but smallest
3. Attack smallest debt first
4. Feel the win, repeat

### The "Good Debt" Myth

All debt costs money. Some is just more expensive than others. Your goal:
minimize the expensive stuff.

## Your First Real Paycheck Plan

That first tech job paycheck hits different. Here's how not to blow it:

### The "Oh Shit I Have Money" Month 1

**What you'll want to do:**

- Buy everything
- Eat at real restaurants daily
- Get the apartment with exposed brick
- Subscribe to everything

**What you should do:**

- Celebrate with ONE nice thing
- Keep living like a student for 3 months
- Build emergency fund
- Pay off highest-interest debt

### The Lifestyle Creep Prevention Plan

**Month 1-3:** Live on 50% of new income **Month 4-6:** Live on 70% of new
income **Month 7+:** Find your sustainable level

**The saved money goes to:**

1. 1-month emergency fund
2. High-interest debt
3. 3-month emergency fund
4. Fun stuff (finally!)

## Try This Now (10 minutes)

**The No-Shame Money Move**

Pick ONE: ‚ñ° Check your bank balance (even if scary) ‚ñ° Cancel one subscription
you don't use ‚ñ° Find one bill you can reduce ‚ñ° Sign up for one student discount
‚ñ° Move $10 to savings (or even $1)

- GitHub Student Pack (free everything)
- Your campus gym (already paid for!)

### The Side Hustle Reality

**Good student side hustles:**

- Tutoring ($20-50/hour)
- Campus IT help desk
- Freelance coding projects
- Food delivery (you pick hours)
- Teaching assistant positions

**Bad student side hustles:**

- MLMs (run away)
- Crypto day trading (unless you can lose it)
- Anything requiring upfront investment
- "Passive income" that isn't passive

## The Money Scripts for Adulting

### Asking for more money (part-time job)

"I've been here for [time] and have taken on [responsibilities]. Based on my
performance and market rates, could we discuss adjusting my hourly rate?"

### Negotiating bills

"I'm a student on a tight budget. Are there any discounts or payment plans
available?"

### Talking to parents about money

"Can we talk about expectations around money? I want to understand what support
is available and what I need to cover myself."

### Setting money boundaries with friends

"That sounds fun but it's not in my budget this month. Could we do [free
alternative] instead?"

## The Financial Wellness Minimums

Whatever your situation, protect these:

**Daily:**

- Know what's in your checking account
- Avoid overdraft fees at all costs

**Weekly:**

- Check all your accounts
- Track where money went

**Monthly:**

- Pay all bills on time (even minimums)
- Move ANY amount to savings
- Review subscriptions

**Yearly:**

- Check credit report (free!)
- File taxes (get that refund)
- Renegotiate recurring bills

## The Money Mindset Shift

**Old:** "I'm bad with money" **New:** "I'm learning about money"

**Old:** "I'm broke" **New:** "I'm pre-rich"

**Old:** "I can't afford anything" **New:** "I'm choosing different priorities"

**Old:** "Money is stressful" **New:** "Money is a tool I'm learning to use"

## Remember This

Being broke in college doesn't mean you're bad with money. It means you're
investing in your future instead of your present.

Every billionaire has a story about being broke. Every successful person ate
ramen at some point. Every adult had that first credit card mistake.

You're not behind. You're not failing. You're exactly where most people start.

The difference? You're actually thinking about this stuff now, not in 10 years
when it's harder to fix.

Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can. Even $1 saved is better
than $0. Even knowing your debt total is better than avoiding it.

Your relationship with money will evolve. Start with kindness toward yourself.

# Mindfulness Basics

**Time:** 50 minutes  
**Purpose:** Develop practical mindfulness skills to stay present, reduce reactivity, and build resilience

## What Is Mindfulness?

Mindfulness isn't about emptying your mind or feeling peaceful all the time. It's about paying attention to the present moment with curiosity and acceptance—not judgment. Think of it as training your attention muscle to be where you are, when you are there.

**When emotions are strong:** ___/10

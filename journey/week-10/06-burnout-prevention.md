**Early detection is crucial.** The earlier you catch warning signs, the easier it is to course-correct.

**One size doesn't fit all.** Your burnout triggers and prevention strategies are unique to your personality and situation.

**Recovery is not optional.** Regular recovery isn't a luxury—it's a requirement for sustainable high performance.

**Support systems matter.** Burnout thrives in isolation. Building and maintaining support networks is essential for prevention.

# Week 1: Meditation & Reflection

_Take a deep breath. You've discovered so much about yourself this week. Let's pause and reflect._

## Quick Reflection (2 minutes)

What surprised you most about yourself this week?

What aspect of your personality are you most grateful for?

What feels challenging to accept about yourself?

## Scripture to Sit With

> "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart." - Jeremiah 1:5

> "For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do." - Ephesians 2:10

## The Heart of It

Nothing about your personality surprised God.

That introverted nature? Designed on purpose.\
That analytical mind? He knew you'd have it.\
That emotional intensity? Created with intention.

Look at Jesus' disciples - He didn't choose copies. He chose Peter the impulsive, Thomas the analytical, John the emotional. Each personality was needed.

The same is true for you.

## A Simple Truth

The parts of your personality you struggle with might be gifts you haven't learned to use yet.

Your quietness might be the gift of deep listening.\
Your intensity might be the gift of passion.\
Your need for structure might be the gift of bringing order.\
Your flexibility might be the gift of adapting.

## This Week's Practice

Each morning, try this 30-second practice:

1. Name one aspect of your personality
2. Say "Thank you God for making me ___"
3. Ask "Help me use this well in this lesson"

## A Brief Prayer

_"God, thank you for making me exactly who I am. Help me see myself through Your eyes - not through comparison or criticism, but through love. Give me courage to be authentically myself. Amen."_

## Looking Ahead

Next week you'll explore your values and purpose. Remember: this journey isn't about becoming someone else. It's about becoming the best version of who you already are.

## Rest in This

You are not an accident.\
You are not a mistake.\
You are fearfully and wonderfully made.\
Right now. As you are.

Take that truth into your weekend.

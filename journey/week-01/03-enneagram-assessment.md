## What Is the Enneagram?

While MBTI shows HOW you think, the Enneagram reveals WHY you do what you do. It uncovers:

- Your deepest motivation
- Your core fear
- How you behave under stress
- Your path to growth

Think of it as your emotional operating system—the drivers behind your behavior.

## Stress and Security Points

Each type has two important connections:

- **Stress Point:** Where you go when overwhelmed (usually unhealthy)
- **Security Point:** Where you go when growing (integration)

Understanding these helps you:

1. Recognize when you're stressed
2. Know what growth looks like
3. Develop strategies for both states

## Developer-Specific Patterns

### Common Imposter Syndrome by Type:

- **Type 1:** "My code isn't good enough"
- **Type 2:** "I'm not helpful enough"
- **Type 3:** "I'm not achieving enough"
- **Type 4:** "I'm not special enough"
- **Type 5:** "I don't know enough"
- **Type 6:** "I'm not prepared enough"
- **Type 7:** "I'm missing out"
- **Type 8:** "I'm not strong enough"
- **Type 9:** "I don't matter enough"

## Integration Exercise (15 minutes)

In your journal, reflect on:

1. **Your Core Pattern:**
   When in your developer journey has your core fear shown up?
   When has your core desire driven your decisions?

2. **Stress Signals:**
   What happens to your coding when you're stressed?
   How does your type's stress point manifest?

3. **Growth Edge:**
   What would embracing your security point look like?
   What one practice could move you toward growth?

4. **Type-Specific Challenge:**
   Based on your type, what's your biggest obstacle to growth as a developer?
   What's one small step you could take this week?

## Using This Knowledge

Remember:

- Your type is not an excuse ("I'm a 7, so I can't focus")
- You can develop qualities of all types
- Awareness is the first step to choice
- Growth happens at your edges

## Key Takeaway

The Enneagram shows you your default programming—your automatic responses to the world. Now that you see the pattern, you can choose when to follow it and when to transcend it.

title: "MBTI/16 Personalities: How You Process the World"
estimated_time: 45 minutes
objectives:
  - Complete the 16 Personalities assessment
  - Understand your cognitive function stack
  - Apply MBTI insights to your developer life
  - Identify your strengths and growth areas
---

## What Is MBTI?

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator reveals your cognitive preferences—essentially your brain's default "tech stack" for:

- Taking in information (Sensing vs Intuition)
- Making decisions (Thinking vs Feeling)
- Getting energy (Introversion vs Extraversion)
- Organizing your world (Judging vs Perceiving)

Think of it as your mental operating system's configuration file.

## Take the Assessment

### Step 1: The Test (12 minutes)

1. Go to [16personalities.com](https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test)
2. Answer honestly—choose what feels most natural, not what you do at work
3. Don't overthink—go with your first instinct
4. Save your results (screenshot or write down your type)

### Step 2: Record Your Type

Add to your `journey-journal.md`:

```markdown
## MBTI Results

- Mind: [S/N]% Sensing/Intuitive
- Nature: [T/F]% Thinking/Feeling
- Tactics: [J/P]% Judging/Perceiving

Initial Reaction:
[What resonated? What surprised you?]

## Your Type's Tech Stack Preferences

### Common Patterns by Type:

**Analysts (NT types - INTJ, INTP, ENTJ, ENTP)**

- Love: System design, architecture, optimization
- Tools: Vim/Emacs, Linux, functional languages
- Struggle: User empathy, "good enough" solutions

**Diplomats (NF types - INFJ, INFP, ENFJ, ENFP)**

- Love: User experience, team collaboration, meaningful projects
- Tools: Visual IDEs, collaboration platforms
- Struggle: Harsh criticism, meaningless work

**Sentinels (SJ types - ISTJ, ISFJ, ESTJ, ESFJ)**

- Love: Stable codebases, clear requirements, maintenance
- Tools: Established frameworks, proven solutions
- Struggle: Rapid change, ambiguous requirements

**Explorers (SP types - ISTP, ISFP, ESTP, ESFP)**

- Love: Hands-on debugging, practical solutions, variety
- Tools: Whatever works for the current problem
- Struggle: Long-term planning, excessive documentation

## Reflection Exercise (10 minutes)

In your journal, answer:

1. **When have you been most productive as a developer?**
   What conditions existed? How does this align with your type?

2. **What development tasks drain you most?**
   How might your type explain this?

3. **Looking at your current setup:**

   - Is your IDE configured for your type?
   - Does your schedule honor your energy patterns?
   - Are you in the right role for your preferences?

4. **One change you could make today:**
   Based on your type, what's one small optimization you could implement immediately?

## Working With Other Types

Remember: Every team needs diverse cognitive styles.

- Your opposite type isn't wrong, they're complementary
- Cognitive diversity leads to better solutions
- Understanding differences reduces friction

## Going Deeper

Want to understand your cognitive functions?

- **Dominant:** Your strongest function (autopilot)
- **Auxiliary:** Your supporting function (co-pilot)
- **Tertiary:** Develops in your 20s-30s
- **Inferior:** Your stress point and growth edge

Research your type's function stack for deeper insights.

## Key Takeaway

Your MBTI type isn't a limitation—it's a user manual for your brain. Now you know your default settings. Use them wisely, but don't be afraid to develop your non-preferred functions.

## What Is StrengthsFinder?

StrengthsFinder identifies your natural talent patterns—the things you do effortlessly that others find difficult. These aren't skills (which are learned) but innate talents that can be developed into strengths.

**Formula:** Talent × Investment = Strength

## Key Insights for Developers

1. **Code in your strengths zone:** Align your projects with your talents
2. **Manage weaknesses:** Partner, delegate, or create systems
3. **Name and claim:** Articulate your strengths to others
4. **Invest deliberately:** 10,000 hours in your strength zone > random practice
5. **Stack your strengths:** Combine themes for unique value

## Reflection Exercise (10 minutes)

Consider:

1. Which of your strengths feel most underutilized?
2. How could you reshape your current role to use more strengths?
3. What type of projects would let all 5 strengths shine?
4. Who on your team has complementary strengths?

## Key Takeaway

You don't have to be well-rounded. The best developers lean into their strengths and manage around their weaknesses. Now you know your natural talents—time to develop them into world-class strengths.

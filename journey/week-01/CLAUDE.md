- "Aha" moments about themselves

### Avoid:

- Corporate executive examples
- Assuming prior self-knowledge

## Exercises for This Week

Keep them exploratory:

- Quick personality quizzes
- 5-minute reflections
- Simple pattern noticing
- "Notice this week when..."
- Low-pressure experiments

## Language Specific to Discovery

### Instead of:

- "Personality assessment" → "Getting to know yourself"
- "Psychological profile" → "How you're wired"
- "Cognitive functions" → "How you think"
- "Behavioral patterns" → "What you usually do"
- "Self-actualization" → "Becoming more you"

## Writing Style Notes

### Avoid Em Dashes

- **NO EM DASHES (—)**: They sound too AI-written
- Use shorter sentences instead
- Or use commas for quick asides
- Sometimes a colon works: like this
- Questions can break things up too. See?
- Just write like you're talking to a friend

## Weekly Emotional Arc

**Monday (Lesson 1-2)**: "Welcome! Let's explore who you are" **Wednesday
(Lesson 3-4)**: "Look at all these strengths you have" **Friday (Lesson 5-6)**:
"Your way of being is perfect" **Weekend (Lesson 7-8)**: "Now you know yourself
better"

## Success Metrics

Students should finish Week 1 with:

1. Basic understanding of their personality
2. Appreciation for their strengths
3. Reduced imposter syndrome
4. Excitement about the journey
5. Tools for self-advocacy

## Special Considerations

### For Skeptics:

- "Try it and see what fits"
- Science-backed but not gospel
- Practical applications emphasized
- Permission to disagree

### For Over-Thinkers:

- "Don't overthink the answers"
- "First instinct is usually right"
- "It's not a test"
- "You can retake anytime"

## Remember

Week 1 is about:

- Making them feel welcome
- Building early confidence
- Normalizing self-discovery
- Creating safe space
- Setting positive tone

Every lesson should make them think: "I'm in the right place."

## Frontmatter Requirements

For all lesson files in this week, use these required frontmatter fields:

- `title`: The lesson title
- `description`: Brief description of the lesson
- `excerpt`: Summary for listing pages
- `index`: Lesson number (1-8) to map to the lessons array in _data.yml
- `objectives`: Learning objectives for the lesson
- `estimated_time`: (optional) Expected completion time

**DO NOT use**: `day`, `week`, or `lesson` fields in frontmatter.

## Navigation System

Navigation is managed through the `_data.yml` file in this week's folder.

The `_data.yml` file contains a `lessons` array that defines the order and
structure of all lessons. Each lesson file includes an `index` field in its
frontmatter to map to this array.

Navigation links are automatically generated by the template - **do not manually
add navigation links at the end of lesson files**.

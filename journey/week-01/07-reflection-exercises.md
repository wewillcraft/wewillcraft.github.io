# Deep Reflection Exercises

**Time:** 60 minutes
**Purpose:** Synthesize your assessments into actionable self-knowledge

## Before You Begin

Gather your results from:

- MBTI/16 Personalities
- Enneagram
- StrengthsFinder
- DISC
- VARK Learning Style
- Chronotype
- Professional Love Language

Have them visible as you work through these exercises.

## Exercise 1: Pattern Recognition (15 minutes)

### The Consistency Check

Look across all your assessments. What themes appear repeatedly?

**Common Pattern Examples:**

- INTJ + Enneagram 5 + Analytical Strength = Deep thinker pattern
- ENFP + Enneagram 7 + Woo Strength = Connector pattern
- ISTJ + Enneagram 1 + Deliberative = Quality guardian pattern

**Your Patterns:**

```markdown
Theme 1: [What shows up everywhere?]
Evidence:

- MBTI:
- Enneagram:
- Strengths:
- DISC:

Theme 2: [Second consistent pattern]
Evidence:

- MBTI:
- Enneagram:
- Strengths:
- DISC:

Theme 3: [Third pattern if applicable]
Evidence:

- MBTI:
- Enneagram:
- Strengths:
- DISC:
```

### The Contradiction Hunt

Where do your assessments seem to disagree? These tensions are often your growth edges.

**Example Tensions:**

- Introvert (MBTI) but High I (DISC) = Selective socialization
- Type 3 achiever but Harmony strength = Success through others
- Visual learner but Auditory processor = Need multimedia

**Your Tensions:**

1.
2.
3.

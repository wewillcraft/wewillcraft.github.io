# Learning & Energy Assessments

**Time:** 45 minutes
**Purpose:** Optimize how, when, and with whom you work best

## Part 1: VARK Learning Style (15 minutes)

### What is VARK?

VARK identifies how you prefer to take in and process information:

- **V**isual: Pictures, diagrams, charts
- **A**uditory: Listening, discussing, explaining
- **R**ead/Write: Text, notes, lists
- **K**inesthetic: Hands-on, practice, experience

### Take the Assessment

**Official VARK:** [vark-learn.com](https://vark-learn.com/the-vark-questionnaire/)

- 16 questions
- Immediate results
- Detailed strategies included

### Developer Applications

#### Visual Learners

**You learn best from:**

- Architecture diagrams
- Flowcharts and mind maps
- Code visualization tools
- Syntax highlighting

**Study hack:** Draw your code logic before writing it. Use tools like Excalidraw or Mermaid diagrams.

#### Auditory Learners

**You learn best from:**

- Video tutorials (with sound on!)
- Pair programming sessions
- Rubber duck debugging (seriously)
- Podcasts and discussions

**Study hack:** Explain your code out loud. Record yourself teaching concepts.

#### Read/Write Learners

**You learn best from:**

- Documentation
- Code comments
- Blog posts and tutorials
- Taking detailed notes

**Study hack:** Write your own documentation. Maintain a learning journal.

#### Kinesthetic Learners

**You learn best from:**

- Coding along with tutorials
- Building projects immediately
- Hackathons and challenges
- Trial and error

**Study hack:** Don't just read about it—build it. Start with tiny prototypes.

## Part 2: Chronotype - When You Peak (15 minutes)

### What's Your Chronotype?

Your chronotype determines when you have the most energy and focus.

### Quick Assessment

**Take the test:** [chronotype-quiz.com](https://thepowerofwhenquiz.com/)

Or use this quick guide:

**Morning Lark (25% of people)**

- Peak focus: 6 AM - 12 PM
- Best for: Deep work, complex problems
- Worst time: After 8 PM

**Night Owl (25% of people)**

- Peak focus: 4 PM - 12 AM
- Best for: Creative work, debugging
- Worst time: Before 10 AM

**Hummingbird (50% of people)**

- Peak focus: 10 AM - 2 PM
- Second peak: 4 PM - 6 PM
- Flexible but needs breaks

### Optimize Your Dev Schedule

#### If You're a Lark:

```
6 AM - 9 AM:   Deep work (hardest coding tasks)
9 AM - 12 PM:  Complex problem solving
12 PM - 3 PM:  Meetings, code reviews
3 PM - 6 PM:   Admin, easy tasks
```

#### If You're an Owl:

```
10 AM - 12 PM: Admin, email, easy tasks
12 PM - 3 PM:  Meetings, collaboration
3 PM - 6 PM:   Warming up, medium tasks
6 PM - 10 PM:  Deep work (hardest coding tasks)
```

#### If You're a Hummingbird:

```
9 AM - 12 PM:  Deep work sprint #1
12 PM - 2 PM:  Active break (walk, lunch)
2 PM - 5 PM:   Deep work sprint #2
5 PM - 6 PM:   Wind down, planning
```

### Energy Protection Strategies

**Block your peak hours** for deep work
**Schedule meetings** during your low energy
**Save debugging** for when you're sharpest
**Do reviews** when you need lower focus

## Part 3: Professional Love Languages (15 minutes)

### The 5 Languages at Work

Gary Chapman's Love Languages apply to professional relationships too:

1. **Words of Affirmation**

   - "Great code!"
   - Public recognition
   - Positive feedback

2. **Quality Time**

   - Pair programming
   - 1-on-1 mentoring
   - Team lunches

3. **Acts of Service**

   - Code reviews
   - Helping debug
   - Documentation

4. **Gifts**

   - Learning resources
   - Conference tickets
   - New tools/equipment

5. **Physical Touch** (Professional Version)
   - High fives
   - Fist bumps
   - Team celebrations

### Quick Self-Assessment

**Which feels best when a colleague does it?**

A. Publicly praises your code solution
B. Spends an hour pair programming with you
C. Refactors your code to help you out
D. Shares a helpful course or book
E. Gives you a high-five after shipping

**Which bothers you most when missing?**

A. Never getting recognition
B. Always working alone
C. No one helping when stuck
D. No learning opportunities
E. No team celebration/connection

### Your Professional Language

**If you chose mostly A:** Words of Affirmation

- You need verbal/written recognition
- PR comments matter to you
- Slack praise energizes you

**If you chose mostly B:** Quality Time

- You thrive on collaboration
- Isolation drains you
- Mentorship feeds you

**If you chose mostly C:** Acts of Service

- Actions > words for you
- You appreciate practical help
- You show care by doing

**If you chose mostly D:** Gifts

- Resources excite you
- You love sharing tools
- Investments in growth matter

**If you chose mostly E:** Physical Touch (Professional)

- Team energy matters
- In-person > remote
- Celebrations fuel you

## Synthesis Exercise (5 minutes)

### Your Optimal Learning Environment

Fill this out based on your assessments:

```markdown
My Learning Profile:

- VARK Style: [Your primary style]
- Peak Hours: [Your best 3-hour window]
- Recharge Activity: [What restores your energy]
- Professional Language: [How you prefer appreciation]

My Ideal Learning Setup:

- Time: [When]
- Format: [How - video/text/hands-on]
- Environment: [Where - quiet/busy/home/office]
- Support: [Solo/pair/group]

One Change I'll Make This Week:
[Specific action based on these insights]
```

## Developer Success Formula

Combine all three for maximum impact:

**Visual Lark who needs Words?**
→ Morning diagram sessions with feedback loops

**Kinesthetic Owl who needs Quality Time?**
→ Evening hackathons with a coding buddy

**Auditory Hummingbird who needs Acts of Service?**
→ Midday pair programming with helpful teammates

## Action Items

1. **Block your peak hours** in your calendar this week
2. **Adjust one learning method** to match your VARK style
3. **Communicate your professional language** to your team
4. **Notice energy patterns** and protect your peaks

## Key Takeaway

You're not lazy when you struggle at 9 AM if you're an owl. You're not antisocial if you need quiet to learn. You're not needy if you thrive on collaboration. You're just working against your nature. Now you know better—work WITH yourself, not against yourself.

## Hey friend! 👋

Congratulations! You've completed Week 1 and learned so much about yourself. In this lesson we're creating something practical - a simple guide that helps others work with you effectively.

## The Big Idea 💡

Just like code has documentation, you need documentation too! A personal "README" helps teammates, managers, and collaborators understand how to bring out your best work.

## Why This Matters

When others understand how you work best:

- Projects run smoother
- Fewer misunderstandings occur
- Trust builds faster
- You get to be yourself without explaining constantly

## Your 15-Minute Mission

Create a simple guide using the template below. Keep it short - one page maximum!

## Quick Win ✅

**Right now:** Think of one person you work with regularly. What would you want them to know about working with you? That's the heart of your user manual!

## Simple User Manual Template

Copy and customize this:

## Real Talk

I used to think sharing my working preferences was demanding or high-maintenance. But when I finally created my user manual, my manager said, "I wish everyone did this! It makes my job so much easier."

People WANT to work well with you - they just don't always know how. A user manual gives them permission to adjust their approach.

## Keep It Simple

Your user manual doesn't need to be perfect or comprehensive. Start with the basics:

- When you work best
- How you communicate
- What you need to succeed
- What typically trips you up

## Key Takeaway

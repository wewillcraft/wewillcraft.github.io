## Hey friend! ðŸ‘‹

So far we've explored your thinking style and motivations. In this lesson we're
looking at how you naturally show up when you're with other people. Think of it
as your communication DNA!

## The Big Idea ðŸ’¡

Your DISC style shows how you naturally communicate and work with others.
Understanding this helps you connect better with teammates and explains why some
people just "click" while others feel harder to work with.

## Why This Matters

When you know your communication style:

- You understand why certain people energize or drain you
- You can adapt your approach to connect with different personalities
- Team conflicts make more sense (and become easier to resolve)
- You communicate in ways that actually get heard

## Your 15-Minute Mission

### Step 1: Take the Assessment (10 minutes)

Go to [Tony Robbins DISC Assessment](https://www.tonyrobbins.com/disc/) and
complete the quick test.

### Step 2: Note Your Style (5 minutes)

Write down your highest letter and what resonated most.

## Quick Win âœ…

**Right now, think about this:** Who was the last person you had a great
conversation with? Who was the last person you found exhausting to talk to? Your
DISC style will help explain why!

## The Four Styles (You're Probably A Mix!)

**D - Driver:** "Let's get it done!"

- Direct, results-focused, loves challenges
- Communicates: Fast, bottom-line first
- Needs: Control and quick decisions

**I - Influencer:** "Let's make it fun!"

- Enthusiastic, people-focused, loves variety
- Communicates: Stories, excitement, big picture
- Needs: Social interaction and recognition

**S - Supporter:** "Let's make sure everyone's okay"

- Needs: Stability and appreciation

**C - Careful:** "Let's make sure it's right"

- Accurate, task-focused, loves quality
- Communicates: Details, facts, questions
- Needs: Information and time to decide

## Real Talk

I used to get frustrated with people who wanted to chat before getting to work
(I'm high C). Then I realized they weren't wasting time - they were connecting,
which actually helped them work better! Understanding DISC helped me appreciate
different styles instead of judging them.

No style is better than another. We need all types to build great things
together.

## What This Means For You

**If you're high D:** Others might see you as pushy. Practice pausing to hear
their perspective.

**If you're high I:** Others might see you as scattered. Practice following
through on commitments.

**If you're high S:** Others might see you as slow. Practice sharing your
thoughts even when you're not 100% sure.

**If you're high C:** Others might see you as critical. Practice highlighting
what's working before suggesting improvements.

## Key Takeaway

There's no wrong way to be human. Understanding your communication style helps
you connect authentically with others while being true to yourself. ðŸŽ¯

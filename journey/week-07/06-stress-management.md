# Stress Management Techniques

## Introduction

Stress is an inevitable part of professional life, especially in technology where complexity, rapid change, and high expectations create constant pressure. However, stress doesn't have to lead to burnout or decreased performance. This lesson provides evidence-based techniques for managing both acute stress (immediate pressure situations) and chronic stress (ongoing work and life pressures).

The goal isn't to eliminate stress entirely—some stress is beneficial for performance and growth. Instead, we'll focus on building resilience, developing effective coping strategies, and creating systems that prevent stress from becoming overwhelming or destructive.

Understanding your personal stress patterns and responses allows you to choose the most effective interventions for your situation, personality, and lifestyle.

## Understanding Stress and Its Effects

### Types of Professional Stress

**Acute Stress**
- Immediate pressure from deadlines, difficult bugs, or high-stakes presentations
- Short-term but intense stress responses that require immediate management
- Can enhance performance when properly managed
- Becomes problematic when frequency is too high or recovery is inadequate

**Chronic Stress**
- Ongoing pressure from workload, job insecurity, or difficult work relationships
- Long-term stress that affects health, performance, and life satisfaction
- Often less noticeable but more damaging than acute stress
- Requires systematic management and lifestyle adjustments

**Hidden Stress Sources**
- Perfectionism and unrealistic self-expectations
- Imposter syndrome and fear of being "found out"
- Keeping up with rapidly changing technology
- Work-life boundary challenges
- Financial pressure and career uncertainty

### Physiological Stress Response

**Immediate Stress Response**
- Increased heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate
- Muscle tension and heightened alertness
- Stress hormone release (cortisol, adrenaline)

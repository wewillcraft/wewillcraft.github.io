# Week 7: Meditation & Reflection

_A quick reflection on sustainability, rest, and God's rhythm for life._

## This Week's Truth

You explored preventing burnout, managing energy, and creating sustainable pace. Here's what God wants you to know: **Rest isn't lazy. It's holy.** God literally built rest into creation's design.

## Scripture to Ponder

> "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest." - Matthew 11:28

> "In vain you rise early and stay up late, toiling for food to eatâ€”for he grants sleep to those he loves." - Psalm 127:2

## Quick Reflection Questions

Take 2 minutes to think about:

1. **Where are you running on empty right now?** What's driving you to push past healthy limits?

2. **What lies about rest do you believe?** That you'll fall behind? That rest equals laziness? That your worth comes from productivity?

3. **When do you feel most alive and energized?** What patterns support your best self?

## The Heart Behind It

God worked six days and rested on the seventh. Not because He was tired, but to show us the pattern. If the Creator of the universe prioritized rest, who are we to think we don't need it?

The world says: "Hustle harder."
God says: "Come and rest."

**Your worth doesn't come from your output.** You're loved at your most productive and in your deepest exhaustion. Rest doesn't diminish your value. It restores it.

## This Week's Practice

**The Evening Shutdown** (3 minutes)

Tonight, set a specific time to stop working. When that time comes:

1. Close your laptop
2. Take three deep breaths
3. Say: "Today's work is enough. Tomorrow is a new day."

No guilt. No "just one more thing." Just stop.

## A Short Prayer

"God, help me trust that You hold all things together, even when I rest. Free me from the lie that my worth comes from constant productivity. Teach me Your rhythm of work and rest. Show me that stopping doesn't mean falling behind, it means following Your design. Give me courage to rest. Amen."

## Looking Ahead

Next week is about boundaries. Remember: rest is a boundary. It's saying "I am human, not machine."

## Remember This

You weren't designed to run 24/7. Even your phone needs charging.

God grants sleep to those He loves. That includes you.

Rest well this weekend.

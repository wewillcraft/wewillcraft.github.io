# Day 9: Your Energy Detective Week

Hey friend! 👋

## The Big Idea 💡

This week you're becoming an energy detective, collecting clues about when you
shine and what drains you. No judging, no fixing - just honest observation.
Think of it like profiling your own energy patterns.

## Why This Matters

You know how some days you feel unstoppable and others you can barely function?
That's not random. There are patterns hiding in your daily rhythms, and once you
spot them, you can design your perfect day instead of hoping for good energy.

## Your 15-20 Minute Mission

### Step 1: Simple Morning Check (2 minutes)

When you start your day, quickly note:

- How many hours did you sleep?
- How do you FEEL right now? (energized, normal, or sluggish)
- Rate your energy: Physical, Mental, Emotional, Motivation (each 1-10)

### Step 2: Super Simple Hourly Tracking (30 seconds each)

Every hour, just jot down:

- Time
- What you're doing
- Energy level (use emojis if easier: 🔥 = high, ✅ = good, 😐 = meh, 😫 = low)
- One-word feeling

### Step 3: Evening Wrap-up (3 minutes)

- When did you feel most alive in this lesson?
- What drained you?
- One surprise about your energy

### Step 4: Look for Clues

After a few days, you'll start seeing patterns. When do you crash? When do you
soar?

## Quick Win ✅

Right now, before doing anything else, rate your current energy on these four
areas (1-10):

- Physical: How does your body feel?
- Mental: How sharp is your thinking?
- Emotional: How's your mood?
- Motivation: How much do you want to tackle things?

That's it! You've started tracking.

## Real Talk 💬

I know tracking feels like extra work when you're already busy, but here's the
thing: you're already living with your energy patterns - you're just not seeing
them clearly. One week of paying attention will save you months of feeling
frustrated by "random" good and bad days.

You're not trying to have perfect energy this week. You're just collecting clues
about what makes you tick.

## Key Takeaway

You're a scientist this week, not a judge. Every energy crash is valuable data,
every peak is a clue.

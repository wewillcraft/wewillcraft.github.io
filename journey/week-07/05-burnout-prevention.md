## Hey friend! üëã

Burnout isn't sudden‚Äîit's a slow burn that starts when you ignore the warning
signs. Let's build your early warning system before you need it.

## The Big Idea üí°

**Burnout prevention is 10x easier than burnout recovery. Learn your warning
signs now.**

For developers, perfectionism + tech FOMO + crunch culture = perfect burnout
storm.

## Why This Matters

Burnout recovery can take months or years. But prevention? Just a few minutes of
daily awareness.

Tech careers are marathons, not sprints. The habits you build now determine
whether you'll still love coding in 10 years.

## Your 15-Minute Mission

### Step 1: Know the Three Faces (5 minutes)

**Emotional Exhaustion**: Chronic fatigue that rest doesn't fix **Cynicism**:
"This code sucks, users are idiots, management is clueless"\
**Inefficiency**: Working harder but accomplishing less

Recognize these patterns‚Äîthey're your warning system.

### Step 2: Identify Your Triggers (5 minutes)

**Common developer burnout triggers:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Never shipping "good enough" code
(perfectionism) ‚ö†Ô∏è Feeling behind on every new framework (FOMO) ‚ö†Ô∏è Normalizing
unsustainable work patterns (crunch addiction) ‚ö†Ô∏è Measuring yourself against
tech Twitter (comparison trap) ‚ö†Ô∏è "Everyone knows more than me" spirals
(imposter syndrome)

### Step 3: Build Your Warning System (5 minutes)

**Physical signals:**

- Sleep problems or constant tiredness
- More frequent illness
- Tension headaches or back pain

**Emotional signals:**

- Dreading work you used to enjoy
- Increased irritability with teammates
- Loss of excitement about new technologies

**Behavioral signals:**

- Procrastinating on important tasks
- Isolation from team activities
- Perfectionism or inability to ship

## Quick Win ‚úÖ

**Right now, do a baseline check:**

1. Rate your energy level (1-10) over the past two weeks
2. Identify your #1 current work stressor
3. Name one thing you've been avoiding/procrastinating
4. Set a daily reminder: "How's my energy in this lesson?"

This creates awareness so you can catch changes early.

## Real Talk üí¨

Developer culture glorifies the hustle. You'll see tweets about 80-hour weeks
and coding marathons.

Here's the truth: The developers with 20-year careers didn't burn out in year 2.

If you've been saying "things will slow down after this project" for months,
you're already in the danger zone.

Remember:

- Taking breaks isn't lazy
- Setting boundaries isn't weak
- Saying no isn't selfish

These are professional skills.

## Your Burnout Prevention Protocol

**Daily**: Check in with your energy level (1-10) **Weekly**: Ask "What drained
me? What energized me?"\
**Monthly**: Audit your systems and boundaries

## Key Takeaway

Burnout prevention is like version control for your mental health‚Äîsmall, regular
commits prevent massive conflicts later. Your career is a marathon, not a sprint
to impress LinkedIn.

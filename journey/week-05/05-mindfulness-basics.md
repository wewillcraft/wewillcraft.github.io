# Mindfulness Basics

**Time:** 25 minutes\
**Vibe:** Making mindfulness actually doable üéØ

Let's get one thing straight: mindfulness isn't about sitting in perfect silence
for hours or emptying your mind. It's about paying attention to right now,
without judging yourself for it.

## What's Mindfulness, Really?

It's like becoming the narrator of your own life instead of just being swept
along by it. You start noticing what's happening in your mind and body as it
happens.

**Quick mindfulness check:** Right now, can you feel your feet in your shoes?
Your back against your chair? That's mindfulness in action!

## Where Are You Usually?

Rate your typical presence level (1=totally zoned out, 10=completely here):

**During daily tasks** (eating, walking, showering): ___/10\
**During work or studying:** ___/10\
**During conversations:** ___/10\
**When you're stressed:** ___/10\
**When emotions are intense:** ___/10

## What Makes Staying Present Hard?

‚ñ° Mind constantly planning/worrying\
‚ñ° Emotions feel too intense ‚ñ° Too many distractions everywhere ‚ñ° Feels like
"wasting time" ‚ñ° Don't know what I'm "supposed" to do ‚ñ° Physical restlessness ‚ñ°
Judge myself when mind wanders

## Remember This

Mindfulness isn't about being perfect or achieving some zen state. It's about
being present for your actual life as it's happening. Every moment you notice
you're distracted and come back - that's a victory, not a failure.

You're not trying to become a different person. You're just getting to know the
person you already are. üíô

# Flow State Engineering

## Introduction

Flow is the holy grail of focused performance—that magical state where time disappears, distractions vanish, and you're completely absorbed in your work. In flow, your skills feel perfectly matched to the challenge, your actions feel effortless, and you produce your best work with surprising ease.

While flow might seem spontaneous and unpredictable, decades of research by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and others have revealed that flow states have specific, measurable conditions. This means you can engineer the circumstances that make flow more likely to occur.

This lesson will teach you to identify your personal flow triggers, create optimal challenge-skill balance, and design environments and practices that reliably induce peak performance states in your technical work.

## The Science of Flow

- Toxic positivity

## Exercises for This Week

Reflection and action focused:

- Failure inventory with lessons
- Stress level assessments
- Support network mapping
- Recovery protocol design
- Growth tracking journals

## Language Specific to Resilience

### Instead of:

- "Bounce back" → "Move forward"
- "Get over it" → "Work through it"
- "Stay strong" → "Be human"
- "Push through" → "Navigate wisely"
- "Tough it out" → "Find your way"

## Weekly Emotional Arc

**Monday (Lesson 1-2)**: "Let's look at failure differently"
**Wednesday (Lesson 3-4)**: "You have more tools than you think"
**Friday (Lesson 5-6)**: "You're not alone in this"
**Weekend (Lesson 7-8)**: "You can handle whatever comes"

## Success Metrics

Students should finish Week 5 with:

1. Reframed relationship with failure
2. Concrete resilience strategies
3. Active support network
4. Emotional regulation tools
5. Personal recovery protocols

## Special Considerations

### For Perfectionists:

- Failure doesn't mean you're failing
- High standards can coexist with self-compassion
- Mistakes are data points
- Perfect resilience doesn't exist

### For Those Struggling:

- It's okay to not be okay
- Resilience isn't about not feeling
- Take the time you need
- Professional help is valid

## Writing Style Notes

### Avoid Em Dashes

- **NO EM DASHES (—)**: They sound too AI-written
- Use shorter sentences instead
- Or use commas for quick asides
- Sometimes a colon works: like this
- Questions can break things up too. See?
- Just write like you're talking to a friend

## Remember

This week is about:

- Building real resilience
- Not pretending everything's fine
- Practical tools over platitudes
- Self-compassion with accountability
- Growth through struggle

Every lesson should reinforce: "You can handle hard things."

## Frontmatter Requirements

For all lesson files in this week, use these required frontmatter fields:

- `title`: The lesson title
- `description`: Brief description of the lesson
- `excerpt`: Summary for listing pages
- `index`: Lesson number (1-8) to map to the lessons array in _data.yml
- `objectives`: Learning objectives for the lesson
- `estimated_time`: (optional) Expected completion time

**DO NOT use**: `day`, `week`, or `lesson` fields in frontmatter.

## Navigation System

Navigation is managed through the `_data.yml` file in this week's folder.

The `_data.yml` file contains a `lessons` array that defines the order and structure of all lessons. Each lesson file includes an `index` field in its frontmatter to map to this array.

Navigation links are automatically generated by the template - **do not manually add navigation links at the end of lesson files**.

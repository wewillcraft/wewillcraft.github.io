## The Developer's Relationship with Failure

**Common Tech Failures and Lessons:**

- **Bugs in production** → Better testing practices
- **Failed deployments** → Improved CI/CD processes
- **Rejected pull requests** → Code quality awareness
- **Project cancellations** → Market validation skills
- **Team conflicts** → Communication improvement

**The Debugging Mindset:**

1. **Isolate the problem** (don't catastrophize)
2. **Gather information** (what actually happened?)
3. **Form hypotheses** (possible causes)
4. **Test systematically** (try solutions)
5. **Document learnings** (prevent future occurrences)

## Resilience vs. Antifragility

**Resilient Systems:** Return to original state after stress

- Bounce back from failure
- Maintain current capabilities
- Focus on recovery

**Antifragile Systems:** Get stronger from stress

- Use failure as fuel for growth
- Develop new capabilities
- Focus on adaptation and evolution

**Tech Industry Examples:**

- **Rejection letters** from dream companies
- **Failed startups** and what you learned
- **Projects that didn't work** and why

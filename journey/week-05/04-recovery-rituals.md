Recovery isn't just "doing nothing." It's like charging your phone - you need
the right practices to actually restore your energy and resilience.

## How Do You Currently "Recover"?

Be honest - after a tough day, what do you actually do?

‚ñ° Scroll social media for hours\
‚ñ° Binge-watch Netflix ‚ñ° Go to bed early (but can't sleep) ‚ñ° Work more to
distract yourself ‚ñ° Stress eat or stress shop ‚ñ° Exercise or go for a walk ‚ñ° Talk
to someone you trust ‚ñ° Creative activities ‚ñ° Bath/shower ritual

## Recovery Reminders

Recovery isn't optional - it's essential. You don't earn rest by working hard
enough. You deserve recovery simply because you're human and you matter.

Think of recovery as sharpening your saw. The sharper it is, the easier
everything else becomes. üåü

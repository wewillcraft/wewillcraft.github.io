**Lunch:** "Am I in green, yellow, or red zone?"

**Evening:** "What signals showed up in this lesson? What worked to help?"

## This Week's Challenge

## Remember This

Your stress signals aren't your enemy - they're your body trying to help you. Think of them as your personal early warning system, not something to ignore or push through.

The goal isn't to never feel stressed. It's to catch stress early and respond with kindness instead of letting it steamroll you.

You're already doing great by paying attention! üíô

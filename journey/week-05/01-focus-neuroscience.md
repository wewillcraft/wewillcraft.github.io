## Overview

Focus isn't about willpowerâ€”it's about understanding how your brain's attention system works. By learning the neuroscience behind focus and distraction, you can work with your brain's natural patterns instead of against them.

## Core Concepts

### Attention Networks

- **Alerting Network**: Staying vigilant and ready
- **Orienting Network**: Directing attention to specific locations
- **Executive Network**: Resolving conflicts and maintaining focus

### The Cost of Context Switching

- Average 23 minutes to fully refocus after interruption
- Mental residue from incomplete tasks
- Cognitive overhead of task switching

### Default Mode Network

- Your brain's "screensaver" when not focused
- Mind-wandering and internal distractions
- Training focused attention vs. letting it drift

## Exercises

1. **Attention Audit** (20 min)

   - Track interruptions for one day
   - Identify your distraction patterns
   - Calculate focus vs. fragmented time

2. **Focus Baseline Test** (15 min)

   - Single-task coding session
   - Note when attention wavers
   - Measure deep focus duration

3. **Brain State Awareness** (10 min)
   - Practice noticing mind-wandering
   - Identify focus vs. distraction feelings
   - Build metacognitive awareness

## Deliverables

- Personal attention audit results
- Focus baseline measurements
- Brain state awareness notes

## Next Steps

With understanding of how focus works, you'll design digital environments that support sustained attention.

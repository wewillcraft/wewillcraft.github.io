# Team Dynamics üë•‚ö°

**Time:** 25 minutes\
**Purpose:** Learn to read the room and help teams work together like magic!

Hey there! Ever notice how some groups just... click? Everyone's laughing, contributing, and getting stuff done. Then other groups feel awkward, tense, or like pulling teeth to get participation. The difference isn't luck - it's team dynamics. Let's learn how to create the magic! ‚ú®

## What Are Team Dynamics Anyway?

Think of team dynamics as the "vibe" or invisible energy between group members. It's:

- How comfortable people feel speaking up
- Whether conflicts get ugly or productive
- If everyone participates or a few people dominate
- Whether the group feels energizing or draining

You know good team dynamics when you see them! üéØ

- Take risks and try new things

- Ask for help when you need it
- Admit when you're wrong

**Respond Well to "Bad" News**

- Thank people for speaking up
- Ask "What can we learn?" not "Who messed up?"
- Celebrate intelligent failures
- Focus on fixing, not blaming

**Show Genuine Curiosity**

- Ask people what they think
- Listen without immediately judging
- Build on their ideas
- Value their different perspectives

## College Team Dynamics Situations

### The Group Project From Hell

**The Situation:** One person does all the work, others coast or disappear

**Poor Dynamics Response:** Complain, do everything yourself, passive-aggressive comments

**Great Dynamics Response:**

- Have an honest conversation about expectations
- Create clear roles and deadlines
- Build in accountability check-ins
- Address issues directly but kindly

### The Awkward Study Group

**The Situation:** Some people dominate, others stay silent

**Poor Dynamics Response:** Let it continue, suffer in silence

**Great Dynamics Response:**

- "Let's hear from someone who hasn't shared yet"
- Break into smaller discussion pairs
- Rotate who leads different topics
- Create space for different communication styles

### The Club Committee Drama

**The Situation:** Two people clash and make meetings tense

**Poor Dynamics Response:** Hope it goes away, take sides, avoid meetings

**Great Dynamics Response:**

- Address it directly but privately first
- Focus on behavior, not personality
- Find common ground and shared goals
- Set clear expectations for professional behavior

## The Team Leader's Toolkit üß∞

### Daily Practices:

- **Thank people for speaking up:** Even if you disagree with their ideas

- **Ask for feedback:** "What's working well? What should we adjust?"

### Weekly Practices:

- **Team retrospectives:** What went well? What could improve?
- **One-on-one check-ins:** How is each person feeling about the team?
- **Celebrate wins together:** Both big achievements and small progress
- **Address issues quickly:** Don't let problems fester

### Meeting Magic:

- **Round-robins:** Everyone shares one idea before discussion starts
- **"Yes, and" rule:** Build on ideas instead of shutting them down
- **Parking lot:** Write down off-topic ideas to discuss later
- **Time limits:** Keep discussions focused and inclusive

## Conflict: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly

## Red Flags to Watch For üö©

**Warning Signs of Poor Team Dynamics:**

- People stop contributing ideas
- Side conversations and complaints increase
- Meeting attendance drops
- Quality of work suffers
- People start avoiding team interactions
- You're doing most of the talking

**When you see these:** Don't ignore them! Address directly but kindly.

## Quick Team Energy Boosters

When your team feels flat:

- **Change the environment:** Meet somewhere different
- **Start with something fun:** Icebreaker, quick win, celebration
- **Get physical:** Stand up, walk around, change positions
- **Ask better questions:** "What would make this more engaging for everyone?"
- **Share a win:** Celebrate recent progress or achievements

## The Team Dynamics Mindset

**Remember:**

- Every team goes through awkward phases - that's normal!
- Your energy and attitude sets the tone for others
- Small improvements in dynamics create big results
- People want to contribute - sometimes they just need the right environment
- Psychological safety isn't "soft stuff" - it drives performance

## Emergency Team Rescue Protocol

When things go really wrong:

1. **Pause and assess:** What's really going on under the surface?
2. **Talk to people individually:** Get the real story from each person
3. **Address issues directly:** Have the hard conversations
4. **Reset expectations:** What do we need going forward?
5. **Create quick wins:** Build momentum with small successes
6. **Monitor closely:** Check in frequently until things stabilize

## The Bottom Line

Great team dynamics don't happen by accident. They happen when someone (that's you!) pays attention to how people interact and takes action to make it better.

You're not trying to be everyone's best friend. You're trying to create an environment where everyone can do their best work and feel good about being part of the team.

When you get this right, everything else gets easier. Projects flow better, stress decreases, and people actually look forward to working together. That's leadership magic! ‚ú®

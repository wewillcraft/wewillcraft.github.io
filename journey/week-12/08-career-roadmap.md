## The Career Roadmap Reality üó∫Ô∏è

Here's what most career advice gets wrong: **They act like you can plan your career like a GPS route.**

Real careers are messier. They zigzag, hit detours, and sometimes involve complete U-turns. The goal isn't to predict every step‚Äîit's to be ready for whatever comes next.

Today we're building a roadmap that's flexible enough to handle reality.

## Why You Need a Career Roadmap

**Without a roadmap:**
- Every opportunity feels equally important
- You say yes to things that don't move you forward
- You react instead of being strategic
- Five years pass and you wonder what happened

**With a roadmap:**
- You can spot opportunities that align with your goals
- You make decisions faster and with more confidence
- You build skills and relationships intentionally
- You create momentum instead of just motion

## Your Career Vision (Refined) ‚ú®

Let's get specific about where you're heading:

### 10-Year Vision Statement

Fill in the blanks:
**"By 2034, I will be __________ [role/title] in __________ [industry/company type], where I __________ [primary responsibility] and make impact by __________ [key contribution]. I'll be known for __________ [reputation/expertise]."**

**Your version:**
___________

### Vision Check-In Questions

**Does this vision:**
- Excite you when you think about it? Y/N
- Align with your core values? Y/N
- Feel challenging but achievable? Y/N

If you answered "no" to any, revise your vision.

**Financial Security (10%):**

### Your Decision Matrix

Create a simple scoring system (1-10) for evaluating opportunities:
- Strategic Fit: ___ x 4 = ___
- Learning & Growth: ___ x 3 = ___
- Quality of Life: ___ x 2 = ___

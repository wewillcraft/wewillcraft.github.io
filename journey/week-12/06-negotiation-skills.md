## Let's Talk Money üí∞

Here's the uncomfortable truth: **Most people never negotiate their salary.** They get an offer, feel grateful, and say yes immediately.

Then they find out later their colleague makes $15K more for the same role.

Don't be that person.

Today we're learning how to negotiate without feeling sleazy, pushy, or ungrateful.

## Why You Should Always Negotiate

**Reason 1: They expect you to**
Companies typically offer 10-20% below their maximum budget, expecting negotiation.

**Reason 2: It compounds over time**
An extra $5K now becomes $50K+ over your career with raises and new job calculations.

**Reason 3: It sets the tone**
People who negotiate are seen as more confident and valuable.

**Reason 4: The worst they can say is no**
And they won't rescind the offer for asking professionally.

## The Negotiation Mindset Shift üß†

### Old Thinking vs. New Thinking

**Old:** "I should be grateful for any offer"
**New:** "We're discussing a partnership that benefits both sides"

**Old:** "I don't want to seem greedy"
**New:** "I want to be paid fairly for the value I bring"

**Old:** "They might take the offer away"
**New:** "They invested time interviewing me; they want this to work"

**Old:** "I'm not worth more"
**New:** "I researched the market and know my value"

### The Golden Rule

**Negotiation is collaborative, not combative.** You're working together to find a deal that makes both sides happy.

## Research: Know Your Worth üìä

Before any negotiation, you need data:

### Salary Research Tools

**Use these resources:**
- Glassdoor (for company-specific data)
- PayScale (for role and location data)
- Levels.fyi (for tech companies)

**Track these numbers:**
- **Market minimum:** Bottom 25th percentile
- **Market average:** 50th percentile
- **Market high:** 75th+ percentile

## The Negotiation Process üó£Ô∏è

### Step 1: When to Negotiate

**The best time:** After you receive a written offer but before you accept.

**Don't negotiate:**
- During the interview process
- Before you have an offer
- After you've already accepted

### Step 2: The Opening Response

**Don't say yes immediately.** Even if the offer is great.

**Instead, say:**
"Thank you for the offer! I'm excited about the opportunity. I'd like to review everything carefully and get back to you by [specific day]. Is that timeline workable?"

This buys you time to research and prepare.

### Step 3: The Counter-Offer

**Formula for success:**

1. **Express enthusiasm**
2. **Reference market research**
3. **Make specific requests**
4. **Explain your reasoning**
5. **Invite discussion**

### Sample Scripts

**For base salary:**
"I'm really excited about joining the team. Based on my research of the market for [role] in [location], the range seems to be $X to $Y. Given my experience with [specific skills/accomplishments], I was hoping we could discuss a base salary of $[target]. What are your thoughts on that?"

**For multiple items:**
"Thank you again for the offer. I'm very interested in the role. After reviewing everything, I have a few items I'd love to discuss:
- Base salary: $[amount] based on market research
- Start date: [date] to wrap up current projects
- Professional development budget: $[amount] annually
Could we find a way to work together on these items?"

**For non-salary items:**
"The base salary works well for me. I'm wondering if there's flexibility on [specific benefit]. This would be really valuable because [brief reason]. Is this something we could explore?"

### Step 4: The Negotiation Dance

**They might say no initially.** That's normal. Here's how to respond:

**If they say the salary is fixed:**
"I understand budgets can be tight. Are there other areas where we might find flexibility? Maybe the start date, vacation time, or professional development budget?"

**If they need to check with someone:**
"Of course, I appreciate you looking into it. When should I expect to hear back?"

**If they ask for justification:**
"Absolutely! Based on my research on [source], the market range is X to Y. With my experience in [specific skills] and my track record of [specific achievement], I believe I'd bring significant value in those areas."

## Common Negotiation Scenarios üé≠

### Scenario 1: They Say the Budget Is Fixed

**Your response:**
"I understand. Are there other ways we could structure the compensation? Perhaps a signing bonus, earlier review date, or additional vacation time?"

### Scenario 2: They Counter Lower Than Your Ask

**Your response:**
"I appreciate you working with me on this. Could we meet somewhere in the middle at $[amount between their counter and your ask]? I'm really excited about the role and want to make this work."

### Scenario 3: They Ask What You Currently Make

**Your response:**
"I'm looking for roles in the $X to $Y range based on the market and the value I'd bring to this position. How does that align with the budget for this role?"

### Scenario 4: Multiple Offers

**Use leverage carefully:**
"I have another offer with a higher base salary, but I'm more excited about the opportunity here. Is there any flexibility to get closer to that range?"

## What Not to Say ‚ùå

**Don't:**
- "I need the money for [personal reason]"
- "I deserve this because..."
- "Everyone else makes more than me"
- "I'll walk if you don't..."
- "This is my final offer"

**Do:**
- Focus on market value and what you bring
- Stay professional and collaborative
- Be specific with your requests
- Give them time to consider
- Show enthusiasm for the role

## When to Walk Away üö™

Sometimes the answer is genuinely no. Here's when to consider other options:

- The total compensation is significantly below market
- They refuse to negotiate on anything
- The company culture seems toxic
- The role responsibilities don't match what was discussed
- Your gut tells you something's wrong

**How to decline professionally:**
"Thank you for working with me on this. While I'm excited about the opportunity, I don't think we can find a compensation package that works for both of us right now. I appreciate your time and hope our paths cross again in the future."

## After You Reach Agreement ü§ù

**Get everything in writing:** Ask for an updated offer letter with all negotiated terms.

**Express gratitude:** Thank everyone involved in the process.

**Set expectations:** Confirm start date and next steps.

**Stay connected:** The people you negotiated with will be your future colleagues.

## This Week's Action Plan

1. **Research salary ranges** for 3 roles you're interested in
2. **Practice your negotiation scripts** out loud
3. **List your value propositions** - what unique value do you bring?
4. **Identify your negotiation priorities** - what matters most to you?
5. **Find a negotiation buddy** to role-play scenarios with

## The Long Game üéØ

**Negotiation is a skill you'll use throughout your career:**
- Annual raises
- Promotions
- Job changes
- Freelance rates
- Project budgets

Get good at it now, and it will pay dividends forever.

## Remember This

You're not being greedy by negotiating. You're being professional.

Companies budget for negotiation. They expect it. Not negotiating actually signals that you might not know your worth.

Tomorrow, we're talking about career pivots. Because sometimes the best career move is a complete change of direction.

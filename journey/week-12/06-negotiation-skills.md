# Negotiation Skills

**Time:** 90 minutes  
**Purpose:** Develop negotiation strategy and tactics for career advancement

## Everything Is Negotiable

Your salary isn't just a number—it's your professional worth quantified. Yet most people never negotiate, leaving significant money on the table. Master negotiation, and you'll not only earn more but also establish yourself as someone who knows their value.

## Part 4: Negotiation Tactics (15 minutes)

### Opening Moves

**The Appreciation Opener:**
"Thank you for this opportunity. I'm excited about [specific aspects]. After reviewing the offer, I'd like to discuss a few aspects of the compensation package."

**The Research Anchor:**
"Based on my research of similar roles in our market, I was expecting a range of $X to $Y. Could we discuss how we arrived at the current offer?"

**The Value Reminder:**
"Given my experience with [specific valuable skill] and my track record of [specific achievement], I believe there's room to adjust the compensation."

### Negotiation Language

**Instead of:** "I need more money"  
**Say:** "Based on market research and my qualifications, I believe there's an opportunity to optimize the compensation package."

**Instead of:** "That's too low"  
**Say:** "I was hoping we could find a way to bridge the gap between your offer and my research."

**Instead of:** "I have another offer for more"  
**Say:** "I'm evaluating a few opportunities and want to make sure we're creating a competitive package."

**Instead of:** "Take it or leave it"  
**Say:** "This is what would make me most excited to join the team. What flexibility do we have?"

### Handling Objections

**"We don't have budget"**
- "I understand budget constraints. Are there other components we could adjust?"
- "Could we structure a review in 6 months when budgets refresh?"
- "What non-monetary benefits could help bridge the gap?"

**"This is our standard offer"**
- "I appreciate the structure. How does it account for specific experience or skills?"
- "What factors typically influence variations from the standard?"
- "Could we discuss the factors that make this role unique?"

**"You don't have enough experience"**
- "I understand experience considerations. Let me share specific relevant achievements..."
- "What specific experience would justify the adjustment I'm requesting?"
- "How could I demonstrate additional value in the first 90 days?"

### Closing Techniques

**The Summary Close:**
"So if I understand correctly, we can adjust the base to $X, include a sign-on bonus of $Y, and schedule a review in Z months. Is that accurate?"

**The Assumption Close:**
"This package addresses my key priorities. When would you like me to start?"

**The Gratitude Close:**
"I appreciate your flexibility in working with me on this. I'm excited to contribute to [specific company goal]."

## Part 5: Special Situations (10 minutes)

### Multiple Offers

**Leverage Strategy:**
- Don't lie about competing offers
- Use them to understand market value
- Give your preferred company chance to match

Approach it professionally, back your requests with data, and remember that the best negotiations strengthen relationships rather than strain them.

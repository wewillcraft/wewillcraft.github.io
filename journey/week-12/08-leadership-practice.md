## Remember This About Leadership

Leadership isn't about:

- Being perfect or having all the answers
- Being the loudest person in the room
- Controlling everything and everyone
- Never making mistakes

Leadership IS about:

- Creating positive change
- Building relationships and trust
- Learning from every experience
- Serving others, not yourself

You don't need a title to be a leader. You don't need permission to help others succeed. You don't need to wait until you're "ready" - you become ready by practicing!

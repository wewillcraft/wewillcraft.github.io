### Avoid:

- Stanford/MIT examples
- FAANG-only focus

- Perfect linear careers

## Exercises for This Week

Keep them immediately actionable:

- Update ONE section of resume
- Send ONE connection request
- Apply to ONE job
- Practice ONE interview question
- Research ONE company

Not:

- Revamp entire online presence
- Apply to 50 jobs
- Master all interview types
- Network with 100 people

## Language Specific to Career Content

### Instead of:

- "Leverage your competencies" → "Use what you're good at"
- "Optimize your profile" → "Make your profile work for you"
- "Executive presence" → "Professional but still you"
- "Thought leadership" → "Share what you learn"
- "Personal brand" → "How people remember you"

## Writing Style Notes

### Avoid Em Dashes

- **NO EM DASHES (—)**: They sound too AI-written
- Use shorter sentences instead
- Or use commas for quick asides
- Sometimes a colon works: like this
- Questions can break things up too. See?
- Just write like you're talking to a friend

## Weekly Encouragement Arc

**Monday (Lesson 1-2)**: "You have more to offer than you think"
**Wednesday (Lesson 3-4)**: "The right opportunity is out there"
**Friday (Lesson 5-6)**: "You're worth investing in"
**Weekend (Lesson 7-8)**: "Your career is a marathon, not a sprint"

## Success Metrics

Students should finish Week 12 with:

1. A clear next career step (not whole plan)
2. One improved job application asset
3. Reduced anxiety about job hunting
4. Practical templates and scripts
5. Confidence to start applying

## Remember

This week, students need:

- Hope that they'll find something
- Permission to start small
- Practical tools over theory
- Celebration of their progress
- Confidence they're enough

Every lesson should combat the voice saying "You're not ready yet."

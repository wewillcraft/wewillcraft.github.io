# Influence üåüüí´

**Time:** 25 minutes\
**Purpose:** Learn to get people excited about your ideas (without being manipulative!)

Hey there! Ever wonder why some people just seem to have that "it" factor? Why their ideas get adopted, their projects get supported, and people genuinely want to help them succeed? It's not magic - it's influence. And the best part? It's totally learnable! Let's dive in. üöÄ

## Authority vs. Influence: What's the Difference?

**Authority:** "Do this because I'm the boss/president/teacher"
**Influence:** "Do this because it makes sense and you want to"

As a student, you probably don't have much formal authority. But you can build tons of influence! And honestly, influence is way more powerful because people choose to follow you. üí™

## The 6 Influence Superpowers

### 1. The Helper's High (Reciprocity) ü§ù

**The idea:** When you help people first, they naturally want to help you back.

**College examples:**

- Help a classmate with homework they're struggling with
- Share your study notes before asking for theirs
- Introduce someone to a useful connection
- Offer to cover someone's shift before asking them to cover yours

**The magic:** Don't keep score! Help because it's right, not because you expect immediate payback. The reciprocity will come naturally.

### 2. The Commitment Creator (Consistency) ‚úÖ

**The idea:** People want to follow through on things they've committed to, especially publicly.

**How to use it:**

- "What would you be willing to try this week?"
- "Based on your commitment to sustainability..."
- "As someone who values teamwork..."
- Get people to write down their commitments
- Celebrate when people follow through

**Example:** Instead of "You should study more," try "What study schedule would work for you?" When they create the plan, they're more likely to stick to it!

### 3. The Social Proof Power (Following the Crowd) üë•

**The idea:** People look to see what others like them are doing.

**College applications:**

- "Most successful students in this major..."
- "The top-performing study groups do..."
- "Students who get great internships usually..."
- Share success stories of people they can relate to
- Create visible examples of positive behavior

**Example:** "I noticed the students who got the best jobs last year all had side projects" is way more persuasive than "You should start a side project."

### 4. The Likability Factor (People Say Yes to Friends) üòä

**The idea:** We're way more influenced by people we actually like.

**How to become more likable:**

- Find genuine things you have in common
- Ask about their interests and remember the answers
- Give sincere compliments (not fake flattery!)
- Work together on shared goals
- Show vulnerability - admit when you don't know something
- Be genuinely curious about their perspectives

**Remember:** You're not trying to be fake-nice. You're building genuine connections!

### 5. The Expertise Edge (Authority) üß†

**The idea:** People listen to those they see as knowledgeable.

**Build your expertise:**

- Actually know your stuff (do the research!)
- Share helpful insights and resources
- Mention relevant experiences when appropriate
- Admit what you don't know (this actually builds credibility!)
- Help others learn and grow
- Stay current with trends in your field

**Example:** Instead of "Trust me on this," try "I learned about this when I was interning at..." or "I read a fascinating study that showed..."

### 6. The Scarcity Secret (Limited Opportunities) ‚è∞

**The idea:** People value what's rare or limited.

**Ethical applications:**

- "This scholarship deadline is next week"
- "There are only 3 spots left in this program"
- "This networking event happens once a year"
- "This is a unique opportunity to..."

**Warning:** Only use this when it's genuinely true! False scarcity is manipulative and will hurt your reputation.

## Real College Influence Scenarios

### Getting Your Group Project Idea Adopted

**Old approach:** "My idea is best because I worked really hard on it"
**New approach:** "I found examples of three other schools that tried this approach [social proof] and got amazing results. Sarah, since you mentioned wanting to make a real impact [commitment/consistency], this could be perfect. What do you think?"

### Convincing Friends to Study Together

**Old approach:** "We should all study together"
**New approach:** "I've been helping Jake with calculus [reciprocity], and we discovered that explaining concepts to each other really helps both people learn [expertise]. Want to join us? Most of the people who aced this exam last semester studied in groups [social proof]."

### Getting Support for Your Club Event

**Old approach:** "Please come to our event"
**New approach:** "I remember you mentioning you're interested in sustainability [likability/common ground]. We're having an event next week that only happens once a semester [scarcity]. The speakers are experts from companies that hire students like us [authority/social proof]. Would you like me to save you a spot?"

## Your Influence Action Plan

### This Week's Challenges:

**Monday: The Helper**
Help someone with something they're struggling with. Don't mention anything you need from them.

**Wednesday: The Connector**
Introduce two people who should know each other. Watch the magic happen!

**Friday: The Commitment Creator**\
Instead of telling someone what to do, ask them what they're willing to commit to.

### Building Long-Term Influence:

**Daily Practices:**

- Ask one person about something they care about
- Share one piece of helpful information
- Follow through on every commitment you make
- Look for ways to make others look good

**Weekly Practices:**

- Help someone achieve their goals
- Share knowledge or resources generally
- Connect people who should know each other

## Influence Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. The Fake Friend

Pretending to care about someone just to get something from them. People can sense this from a mile away!

### 2. The Know-It-All

Acting like you're an expert when you're not. It destroys credibility fast.

### 3. The Pushy Person

Being aggressive or manipulative. This creates resistance, not influence.

### 4. The Score Keeper

Keeping track of who owes you what. True influence comes from genuine generosity.

### 5. The One-Trick Pony

Only using one influence technique. Different situations call for different approaches.

- Your reputation is your most valuable asset - protect it!
- Small, consistent actions build more influence than big gestures
- People can tell the difference between genuine and manipulative behavior
- The best influence feels like collaboration, not persuasion

## Emergency Influence Situations

1. **Be direct about what you need** (don't make people guess)
2. **Explain why it matters** (connect to their values/interests)
3. **Make it as easy as possible** for them to say yes
4. **Offer something in return** (even if it's just gratitude)
5. **Give them an easy way to say no** (removes pressure)
6. **Follow up appropriately** (don't be a pest, but don't disappear either)

## The Bottom Line

Influence isn't about manipulation or getting people to do things they don't want to do. It's about building genuine relationships, creating value for others, and communicating in ways that resonate with people.

When you master ethical influence, you become someone people want to work with, learn from, and support. These skills will serve you in every relationship, every job interview, every group project, and every leadership role you'll ever have.

Start small, be genuine, and watch your influence grow! üåü

## The Skills Reality Check üìä

Yesterday you figured out where you want to go. Today we're figuring out what you need to pack for the journey.

Here's the uncomfortable truth: **You probably don't have all the skills you need yet.** That's not failure‚Äîthat's just how careers work. Everyone starts somewhere.

The difference between people who make it and people who don't? The ones who make it actually figure out what they're missing and do something about it.

## The "Oh Crap" Moment üòÖ

Ever read a job posting and think "I know like 3 out of 15 of these requirements"? Yeah, that's a skill gap. And it's totally normal.

But here's what's not normal (and what we're fixing today): **Actually mapping what you need to learn instead of just panicking about it.**

## Current You: The Honest Assessment

Let's start with what you actually know (not what you put on your resume when you were desperate).

### Tech Skills Reality Check

Rate yourself honestly (1-5):
- 1 = "I've heard of this"

## The Mindset Shift üß†

Here's what I wish someone had told me earlier:

**You're not behind.** You're exactly where you need to be to start learning what comes next.

**You don't need to know everything.** You need to know enough to add value and keep learning.

**Imposter syndrome is proof you're growing.** Comfort zones are where skills go to die.

## This Week's Mission

1. **Pick your 90-day skill** (just one!)
2. **Find your learning resource** (free is fine to start)
3. **Set up your practice time** (15-30 minutes daily beats 5 hours on Sunday)
4. **Tell someone about it** (accountability kicks in)

## The Long Game

Your skill gaps aren't a weakness‚Äîthey're a roadmap. Every expert was once a beginner who felt overwhelmed by everything they didn't know.

The goal isn't to eliminate all gaps (impossible). It's to close the ones that matter most and stay curious about the rest.

Tomorrow, we'll figure out how to package all these skills into a personal brand that doesn't make you cringe. Spoiler: It's not about being fake‚Äîit's about being strategic.

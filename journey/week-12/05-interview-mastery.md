## The Questions They'll Actually Ask

Forget the "where do you see yourself in 5 years" fluff. Here's what they're really going to ask and why.

### The Real Technical Questions

**Junior/Entry Level:**
- "Walk me through your code for [project on your GitHub]"
- "How would you debug this error?" *shows actual error*
- "What's the difference between [concept A] and [concept B]?"
- "Build a simple [CRUD app/API/component] right now"
- "Explain how [thing you claim to know] works"

**Why they ask:** Can you actually code, or did someone else do your portfolio?

**Mid-Level:**
- "Design a system for [real business problem]"
- "How would you optimize this slow query/function?"
- "Review this code and tell me what's wrong"
- "Explain your architectural decisions on [past project]"
- "How would you handle [specific technical challenge]?"

**Why they ask:** Can you think beyond just making it work?

### The Real Behavioral Questions

**They always ask these:**
- "Tell me about a time you disagreed with someone"
- "Describe a project that went wrong"
- "How do you handle tight deadlines?"
- "Give an example of learning something quickly"
- "When have you had to deal with ambiguous requirements?"

**Why they ask:** Will you be a nightmare to work with?

## The "I Don't Know" Strategy

You WILL hit questions you can't answer. Here's how to handle them like a pro:

### Level 1: The Educated Guess

"I haven't worked with [X] directly, but based on my experience with [similar thing Y], I would guess [reasonable assumption]. Is that on the right track?"

**Example:**
Q: "How does Redis handle cache invalidation?"
A: "I haven't used Redis specifically, but in my experience with caching, I'd guess it uses TTL expiration or maybe an LRU eviction policy. How does Redis actually handle it?"

### Level 2: The Process Answer

"I don't know the answer off the top of my head, but here's how I'd figure it out:
1. [First step]
2. [Second step]
3. [Validation step]"

**Example:**
Q: "What's the time complexity of this algorithm?"
A: "I'm not sure immediately, but I'd analyze it by looking at the nested loops, checking if there's recursion, and counting the operations relative to input size. Can I work through it?"

### Level 3: The Learning Opportunity

"I don't know that yet, but it sounds important for this role. Can you tell me more about how you use [concept] here? I'd prioritize learning it."

**Example:**
Q: "Do you know Kubernetes?"
A: "I don't have hands-on experience with Kubernetes yet, but I understand it's for container orchestration. How critical is it for this role? I'd be excited to learn it."

### Level 4: The Honest Redirect

"I don't know [X], but I do have experience with [related Y] which might be relevant. Would it be helpful if I talked about that instead?"

**Example:**
Q: "Have you used AWS Lambda?"
A: "I haven't used Lambda specifically, but I've built serverless functions on Vercel and understand the event-driven architecture. Would that experience be relevant?"

## Virtual Interview Specific Tips

Most interviews are remote now. Here's what matters:

### Tech Setup (Test Everything Twice)
- Camera at eye level (stack books under laptop)
- Light source in front of you, not behind
- Neutral background or subtle virtual background
- Wired internet if possible
- Phone on silent, notifications off

### The Virtual Presence
- Look at camera when talking (not screen)
- Nod and react visually (they can't feel your energy)
- Speak 10% louder than feels natural
- Have water nearby (mouth gets dry on video)
- Keep notes visible but don't read from them

### Virtual-Specific Questions
**They might ask:**
- "Can you share your screen and walk through your code?"
- "Do you have experience with remote collaboration tools?"
- "How do you stay productive working from home?"
- "What's your ideal remote work setup?"

## Try This Now (20 minutes)

**The Mock Interview Challenge**

1. **Pick three questions from above** (5 minutes)
   - One technical you know
   - One technical you don't know
   - One behavioral

2. **Record yourself answering** (10 minutes)
   - Use your phone or computer
   - Aim for 2-minute answers
   - Practice the "I don't know" strategy

3. **Watch and cringe** (5 minutes)
   - Do you say "um" too much?
   - Are you rambling?
   - Would you hire you?

This is painful but necessary. Do it now before it matters.

## The Technical/Behavioral Balance

Most people prep one or the other. You need both.

### Your Prep Split
**For technical roles:** 60% technical, 40% behavioral
**For product/design roles:** 40% technical, 60% behavioral
**For leadership roles:** 30% technical, 70% behavioral

### Daily Prep Routine (30 minutes)
**Monday/Wednesday/Friday:** Technical prep
- Solve one coding problem
- Review one system design concept
- Debug one broken code sample

**Tuesday/Thursday:** Behavioral prep
- Write out one STAR story
- Practice one answer out loud
- Research one company deeply

**Weekend:** Mock interview
- Get a friend to ask you random questions
- Use Pramp or similar for technical practice
- Review and refine your weak spots

## Questions to Ask Them (The Good Ones)

Stop asking generic questions. Ask ones that show you're thinking:

### About the Role
- "What would make someone exceptionally successful in this role?"
- "What's the biggest challenge this role will tackle in the first 90 days?"
- "How has this role evolved, and where do you see it going?"

### About the Team
- "What's the team's biggest win in the last year?"
- "How does the team handle technical disagreements?"
- "What's the junior/senior balance on the team?"

### About Growth
- "What learning resources does the company provide?"
- "Can you give an example of someone who grew from this role?"
- "How do you measure and reward growth?"

### The Killer Question
"What would make you hesitant to hire someone for this role?"

Then address their concern directly.

## The Follow-Up Game

Most people send generic thank you notes. Stand out:

### The Same-Day Follow-Up
```
Subject: Quick follow-up - [Your name]

Hi [Interviewer],

Our conversation about [specific topic] got me thinking. I found this article/resource about [relevant thing]: [link]

Thought you might find it interesting given your point about [specific thing they mentioned].

Looking forward to next steps!

[Your name]
```

### The Value-Add Follow-Up
```
Subject: Additional thoughts on [problem discussed]

Hi [Interviewer],

I've been thinking about the [specific challenge] we discussed. Here's a quick breakdown of how I might approach it:

1. [Specific idea]
2. [Another idea]
3. [Resource or example]

Would love to explore this further if it's helpful.

Best,
[Your name]
```

## Remember This

The best interview prep isn't memorizing answers. It's:
1. Having real stories from real experience
2. Being comfortable saying "I don't know" gracefully
3. Showing genuine interest in their problems
4. Proving you can learn what you don't know yet

You don't need to be perfect. You need to be authentic, prepared, and curious.

And when you don't know something? That's not failure. That's an opportunity to show how you think. üéØ

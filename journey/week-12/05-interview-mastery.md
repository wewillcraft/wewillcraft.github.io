## The Interview Reality Check üéØ

Here's the truth about interviews: **They're not trying to trick you.** They're trying to figure out if you can do the job and if they want to work with you.

That's it.

But most people make interviews way harder than they need to be by overthinking, over-rehearsing, or under-preparing. Today we're finding the sweet spot.

## What Interviewers Actually Want to Know

Behind every interview question is a deeper question:

**"Tell me about yourself"**
Real question: *Can you communicate clearly and concisely?*

**"Why do you want this job?"**
Real question: *Are you actually interested, or just desperate?*

**"What's your biggest weakness?"**
Real question: *Are you self-aware and working on improvement?*

**"Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"**
Real question: *Will you stick around long enough to be worth hiring?*

**"Any questions for us?"**
Real question: *Did you actually prepare, or are you just winging it?*

## The STORY Method üìñ

Stop giving boring, factual answers. Tell stories instead.

**S** - **Situation:** Set the scene quickly
**T** - **Task:** What you needed to accomplish  
**O** - **Result:** What actually happened (with numbers if possible)
**R** - **Reflection:** What you learned
**Y** - **You:** How this relates to the role you want

# Interview Mastery

**Time:** 90 minutes  
**Purpose:** Develop comprehensive interview skills and preparation system

## Interviews Are Performance Art

The best candidate doesn't always get the job—the best interviewer does. Interviewing is a learnable skill that combines storytelling, psychology, and authentic connection. Master it, and you control your career destiny.

## Part 1: Interview Psychology (15 minutes)

### Understanding the Interviewer

**What they're really asking:**
- "Tell me about yourself" = Can you communicate clearly?
- "Why do you want this job?" = Are you genuinely interested?
- "What's your biggest weakness?" = Are you self-aware?
- "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?" = Will you stick around?
- "Do you have any questions?" = Did you prepare?

### Interview Biases to Navigate

**Halo Effect:**
If they like one thing about you, they'll like everything.
**Strategy:** Lead with your strongest asset

**Confirmation Bias:**
They'll look for evidence supporting their first impression.
**Strategy:** Make a great first 30 seconds count

**Recency Effect:**
They'll remember the last thing you said most clearly.
**Strategy:** End with your strongest points

### The SOAR Framework

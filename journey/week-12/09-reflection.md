# Week 11: Meditation & Reflection

_This week you've been exploring leadership and influence. Let's reflect on what it means to lead like Jesus, who turned worldly ideas about power upside down._

## Quick Reflection (2 minutes)

Where do you already have influence, even without a formal title?

What motivates you to want to lead or influence others?

What would change if you believed leadership is about service, not status?

## Scripture to Sit With

> "Whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all. For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve." - Mark 10:43-45

> "Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves." - Philippians 2:3-4

## The Heart of It

Here's what might surprise you: **Jesus was history's greatest leader, yet never held an official position of power.**

No political office, no corporate title, no military rank. Yet His influence has shaped the world for 2,000+ years. How? **Through servant leadership.**

When disciples argued about who would be greatest, Jesus didn't teach ladder-climbing. He took a towel and washed their feet - the lowest servant's job.

**True leadership is about going low, not climbing high.**

The world says: Lead from the top, demand respect, use people for goals. Jesus says: Lead from the bottom, earn respect through service, invest in people as your primary goal.

**Ultimate power expressed through ultimate service.**

## A Simple Truth

**You don't need a title to be a leader. You just need to care about people and use your influence to serve their good, not your own.**

You already have influence - in your family, friend groups, workplace, community, and everyday interactions. Influence is built through authenticity, competence, character, care, and consistency.

Notice what's missing: titles, credentials, charisma, control.

**The most influential people focus least on building influence and most on serving others well.**

## This Week's Practice

**The Service Challenge (3 minutes daily)**

Each day, find one way to use your influence to serve someone:

- Help with a task or problem
- Use your skills to benefit others
- Encourage someone struggling
- Take on a responsibility to help others
- Connect someone with resources

Pay attention to how serving others affects you and how people respond to servant leadership.

## Remember This

Leading like Jesus takes courage - admitting when you don't know something, empowering others even when they might surpass you, serving when others are climbing, being humble in a self-promoting world.

**Servant leadership creates transformation that continues after you're gone.** It develops other leaders, builds lasting relationships, and creates positive change that multiplies.

Jesus invested three years in twelve people who changed the world - not through charisma or authority, but by modeling the servant leadership they received.

## A Brief Prayer

_"God, thank You for Jesus' example of servant leadership. Forgive me when I've wanted influence for my own benefit. Give me a heart moved by compassion, not impressed by position. Help me use whatever influence I have to build others up. Make me willing to serve like Jesus. Amen."_

## Looking Ahead

Everything you build in career and life should flow from servant leadership - using whatever platform God gives you to love people well.

## Rest in This

**You don't need a title to be a leader. You need a heart that cares.**

Lead like Jesus: with humility, through service, motivated by love.

**The world needs leaders who care more about people than position. You can be that kind of leader, starting right where you are.**

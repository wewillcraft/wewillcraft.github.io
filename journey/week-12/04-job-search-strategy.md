## The Job Search Game üéÆ

Here's what nobody tells you: **Most job hunting advice is terrible.**

"Just apply online!" Wrong. "Network your way in!" Also wrong (if that's all you do).

The truth? You need a strategy that combines multiple approaches, focuses your efforts, and treats job searching like the skill it is.

Today we're building a system that works.

## The Reality About Job Searching

**85% of jobs are never posted online.** They're filled through referrals, internal promotions, or direct outreach.

**Most applications go into a black hole.** Even good ones.

**The best opportunities come through relationships.** But not in the gross, schmoozy way.

So why does everyone focus on online applications? Because it feels like "doing something" even when it's not effective.

## Your Job Search Strategy üéØ

### Step 1: Get Clear on What You Want

Be specific. "A good job" isn't a strategy.

**Your primary target:**
- **Role:** What's the actual job title?
- **Industry:** Where do you want to work?
- **Company size:** Startup chaos? Corporate stability? Scale-up energy?
- **Location:** Remote? Hybrid? Specific city?
- **Salary range:** Be realistic but ambitious
- **Timeline:** When do you need this by?

Fill this out:
**"I'm looking for __________ roles at __________ companies in __________ industry, making __________, starting by __________."**

### Step 2: The 70/20/10 Rule

Don't spread your efforts equally. Focus strategically:

**70% of your time: High-impact activities**
- Networking and relationship building
- Direct outreach to companies you want to work for
- Referrals and warm introductions
- Industry events and communities

**20% of your time: Medium-impact activities**
- Targeted applications to posted jobs
- Recruiter partnerships
- LinkedIn optimization and content

**10% of your time: Low-impact activities**
- Mass applications
- Job fairs
- Cold outreach without research

### Step 3: Target Company Research

Don't apply everywhere. Pick your targets strategically.

**Make 3 lists:**

**Dream Companies (5-10 companies):**
Companies you'd be thrilled to work for
1. ___________
2. ___________
3. ___________

**Good Fit Companies (10-15 companies):**
Companies that align with your goals and values
1. ___________
2. ___________
3. ___________

**Safety Net Companies (5-10 companies):**
Companies you'd accept while looking for something better
1. ___________
2. ___________
3. ___________

## The Research Process üîç

For each target company, find out:

### Company Intelligence
- **What they do:** Can you explain their business in one sentence?
- **How they make money:** What's their business model?
- **Recent news:** Funding? Launches? Changes?
- **Company culture:** What do employees say about working there?
- **Growth stage:** Expanding? Struggling? Stable?

### People Intelligence  
- **Who hires for your role:** Find the hiring manager's name
- **Your potential teammates:** Who would you work with?
- **Alumni connections:** Anyone from your school/previous jobs?
- **Mutual connections:** Who can make an introduction?

### Opportunity Intelligence
- **Current openings:** What roles are they actively hiring for?
- **Future needs:** What skills are they building toward?
- **Team pain points:** What problems could you solve?

## The Multi-Channel Approach üì°

### Channel 1: The Network Play

**Start with warm connections:**
- Friends and family in your field
- Former classmates and colleagues  
- Alumni from your school
- People you've met at events

**How to reach out:**
```
"Hey [Name], hope you're doing well! I'm exploring opportunities in [field] and remembered you work at [company/industry]. Would love to hear about your experience over coffee sometime - no agenda, just curious about your path."
```

**Expand your network:**
- Join professional communities online
- Attend industry meetups and events
- Engage meaningfully on LinkedIn
- Offer help before asking for it

### Channel 2: The Direct Approach

**Research first, then reach out:**
1. Find companies you want to work for
2. Identify the hiring manager or team lead
3. Research their background and interests
4. Send a personalized message

**Template for direct outreach:**
```
Subject: [Specific skill/experience] for [Team/Project]

Hi [Name],

I've been following [Company]'s work on [specific project/initiative] and I'm impressed by [specific detail].

I'm a [your role] with experience in [relevant skills], particularly [specific example relevant to them]. I'd love to learn more about [their current challenges/projects] and share how my background in [specific area] might be helpful.

Would you be open to a brief call this week?

Best,
[Your name]
```

### Channel 3: The Recruiter Partnership

**Find the right recruiters:**
- Specialize in your field
- Have good reputations (check their LinkedIn recommendations)
- Work with companies you're interested in

**How to work with recruiters:**
- Be clear about what you want
- Respond quickly to their messages
- Give feedback after interviews
- Maintain the relationship long-term

### Channel 4: Strategic Applications

**When you do apply online:**
- Tailor your resume to the specific job
- Write a cover letter that shows you researched the company
- Apply early (within the first few days of posting)
- Follow up if you have any connection to the company

## Your Weekly Job Search Schedule üìÖ

## The Job Search Tracker üìä

Track everything in a simple spreadsheet:

**Columns you need:**
- Company name
- Role title
- Contact person
- Application date
- Status (Applied, Interview, Rejected, etc.)
- Follow-up date
- Notes

**Weekly review questions:**
- What worked well this week?
- What didn't work?
- What will you do differently next week?
- Are you getting enough responses?

## Common Job Search Mistakes üö´

**Don't do this:**
- Apply to everything that sounds vaguely relevant
- Use the same resume for every application
- Disappear after applying (no follow-up)
- Focus only on online applications
- Get discouraged by rejection and stop trying

**Do this instead:**
- Be selective and strategic
- Customize everything
- Follow up thoughtfully
- Use multiple search channels
- Learn from each "no" and keep going

## Handling Rejection Like a Pro üí™

**When you get rejected (and you will):**
1. Say thank you for the feedback
2. Ask what you could have done better
3. Request to be considered for future roles
4. Connect with the interviewer on LinkedIn
5. Learn from the experience

**Remember:** Every rejection gets you closer to the right yes.

## Your Action Plan This Week

1. **Define your target** - Fill out the job criteria above
2. **Make your company lists** - Dream, good fit, and safety net
3. **Research 5 companies deeply** - Find contacts and opportunities  
4. **Reach out to 3 people** - Use the templates above
5. **Set up your tracking system** - Use a spreadsheet or tool

## The Mental Game

Job searching can be emotionally brutal. Here's how to stay sane:

- **Set activity goals, not outcome goals** - You control effort, not results
- **Celebrate small wins** - Every conversation and connection matters
- **Take breaks** - Don't job search 24/7
- **Stay curious** - Each conversation teaches you something
- **Remember your worth** - The right opportunity will value what you bring

## The Truth About Job Searching

It's a numbers game, but not the way most people think. It's not about applying to 100 jobs. It's about having 10 meaningful conversations with the right people.

Quality beats quantity every time.

Tomorrow, we're diving into interview mastery. Because all this strategy only works if you can close the deal when you get in the room.

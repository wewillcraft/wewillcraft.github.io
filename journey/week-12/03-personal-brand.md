## Let's Talk About Your Brand üè∑Ô∏è

I know, I know. "Personal brand" sounds like something a LinkedIn influencer would say while posting a photo of their laptop at a coffee shop.

But here's the thing: **You already have a brand.** Every time someone thinks about working with you, they have an impression. The question is: Did you shape that impression on purpose, or did it just... happen?

Today we're making it intentional (without making it weird).

## The Reality Check

Your brand isn't your logo or your perfect LinkedIn headshot. It's what people think when they hear your name.

- "Oh, Alex? They're the one who actually finishes projects on time."
- "Jordan? Super smart, but good luck getting a straight answer."
- "Sam? They make complex stuff make sense."

**What do people think when they hear your name?**

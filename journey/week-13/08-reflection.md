# Week 13: Meditation & Reflection

_This week you've been exploring life integration - living as a whole person
before God. Let's reflect on bringing your faith into every area of life._

## Quick Reflection (2 minutes)

What parts of your life feel most integrated? Which feel fragmented?

How comfortable are you being the same person in every context?

What would change if you believed God cares about every area of your life?

## Scripture to Sit With

> "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul
> and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbor as
> yourself." - Luke 10:27

> "Your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you... So glorify God in your
> body." - 1 Corinthians 6:19-20

## The Heart of It

**God doesn't want just your Sunday mornings. He wants all of you** - your
Monday meetings, Friday friendships, Saturday workouts, late-night worries,
career ambitions, relationship struggles.

**God is interested in your whole life because He loves your whole self.**

We sometimes treat faith like one compartment among many - the "spiritual" box
we open for church but keep closed during "real life." But Jesus calls us to
integrated living - bringing our whole selves into relationship with God.

## A Simple Truth

**God wants ALL of you - not pieces, but the whole you.**

This isn't exhausting - it's liberating:

- You don't have to be different people in different contexts
- You don't have to figure life out alone
- You don't have to compartmentalize your problems
- You don't have to earn God's interest in daily life

**If God lives in you, then everything about your life becomes sacred space.**

How you treat your body matters - it's where God dwells. What you put in your
mind matters. How you handle emotions matters. Your relationships matter. Your
work matters.

## This Week's Practice

**The Wholeness Check-In (3 minutes daily)**

Each morning, check in with yourself as a whole person:

- **Physical:** How is my body feeling? What does it need?
- **Mental:** What's on my mind? How can I feed it well?
- **Emotional:** What am I feeling? What do those emotions tell me?
- **Relational:** How are my key relationships?
- **Spiritual:** How am I sensing God's presence?

Each evening: How did I live as a whole person today? Where was I authentic?
Where fragmented?

**The goal is awareness** - seeing your life as the integrated whole that God
sees.

## Remember This

Living integrated can feel challenging because culture teaches
compartmentalization. Past hurts create walls. Fear of vulnerability keeps us
fragmented.

**But integrated living is actually more restful than fragmented living.** When
you live from your authentic, God-centered self in every context, you get to
just be yourself.

**The same values guide every decision. The same character shows up everywhere.
The same God is available for every challenge.**

Integration looks different in different seasons - student, career-focused,
family, crisis. The goal isn't perfect balance but faithful stewardship in each
season.

## A Brief Prayer

_"God, thank You for loving all of me - not just the 'spiritual' parts, but
every aspect of who I am. Forgive me for compartmentalizing my life. Help me
live as a whole person before You. Teach me to care for my body, mind, and heart
as Your temple. Give me wisdom to steward well everything You've entrusted to
me. Help me be authentic in every context. Use my integrated life to bless
others. Amen."_

## Looking Ahead

As you prepare for the final week, remember that integrated living is the
foundation for everything else. When you're living as a whole person before God,
you can face the future with confidence.

The plans you make, goals you set, and relationships you build can all flow from
this center of wholeness.

## Rest in This

**God doesn't want pieces of you - He wants all of you.** Your physical health,
mental wellness, relationships, work, dreams, and struggles are all part of the
integrated whole that He loves.

**Living as a whole person isn't about perfection - it's about authenticity.**
It's bringing your real self into relationship with God rather than managing
different versions for different contexts.

**Integration is a journey, not a destination.** You're learning to see all of
life as sacred space and live with integrity across every area.

**This kind of living is restful, not stressful.** When you stop
compartmentalizing, you get to just be yourself - beloved by God, authentic with
others, faithful in every context.

**Live as the whole person God created you to be.**

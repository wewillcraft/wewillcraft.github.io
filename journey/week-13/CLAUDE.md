## Language Specific to Impact

### Instead of:

- "Give back when successful" → "Start giving back now"
- "Help when I'm an expert" → "Share what you're learning"
- "Big impact only" → "Small acts compound"
- "Perfect contribution" → "Helpful contribution"
- "When I have time" → "Make time for what matters"

## Writing Style Notes

### Avoid Em Dashes

- **NO EM DASHES (—)**: They sound too AI-written
- Use shorter sentences instead
- Or use commas for quick asides
- Sometimes a colon works: like this
- Questions can break things up too. See?
- Just write like you're talking to a friend

## Weekly Emotional Arc

**Monday (Lesson 1-2)**: "You can make a difference now" **Wednesday (Lesson
3-4)**: "Share your knowledge with others" **Friday (Lesson 5-6)**: "Build
things that matter" **Weekend (Lesson 7-8)**: "Create your impact plan"

now."

## Frontmatter Requirements

For all lesson files in this week, use these required frontmatter fields:

- `title`: The lesson title
- `description`: Brief description of the lesson
- `excerpt`: Summary for listing pages
- `index`: Lesson number (1-8) to map to the lessons array in _data.yml
- `objectives`: Learning objectives for the lesson
- `estimated_time`: (optional) Expected completion time

**DO NOT use**: `day`, `week`, or `lesson` fields in frontmatter.

## Navigation System

Navigation is managed through the `_data.yml` file in this week's folder.

The `_data.yml` file contains a `lessons` array that defines the order and
structure of all lessons. Each lesson file includes an `index` field in its
frontmatter to map to this array.

Navigation links are automatically generated by the template - **do not manually
add navigation links at the end of lesson files**.

# Personal Manifesto

**Time:** 90 minutes

## What is a Personal Manifesto?

It's your constitution. Your north star. Your line in the sand. A manifesto declares:

- Who you are
- What you believe
- What you will and won't do
- How you'll live
- What legacy you'll leave

When life gets complex, your manifesto simplifies decisions.

## Living Your Manifesto

### Daily Practice

Every morning, ask:
"How will I live my manifesto today?"

Every evening, ask:
"Did I honor my manifesto today?"

### Weekly Review

Each Sunday:

- Read your manifesto aloud
- Identify one way you lived it
- Identify one way you violated it
- Adjust for next week

### Decision Filter

For every major decision:

1. Does this align with my manifesto?
2. Which principle does this honor/violate?
3. What would manifesto-me do?

### Accountability

Share your manifesto with:

- One family member
- One close friend
- One mentor/colleague

Ask them to hold you accountable.

## The Evolution Clause

Your manifesto isn't carved in stone. It should evolve as you grow.

**Review and revise:**

- Quarterly for the first year
- Annually thereafter
- After major life events

**Track changes:**
Document what changes and why. Your evolution tells a story.

## Manifesto in Action

### Scenario Testing

How would your manifesto guide you in:

**Job offer with 2x salary but violates values?**
My manifesto says: \***\*\_\_\_\*\***

**Opportunity to work on cutting-edge tech that might harm users?**
My manifesto says: \***\*\_\_\_\*\***

**Pressure to ship code you know isn't ready?**
My manifesto says: \***\*\_\_\_\*\***

**Chance to take credit for team's work?**
My manifesto says: \***\*\_\_\_\*\***

**Conflict between personal life and career opportunity?**
My manifesto says: \***\*\_\_\_\*\***

## Inspiration Gallery

### Famous Developer Manifestos

**The Agile Manifesto:**
Values interactions over processes, working software over documentation

**The Zen of Python:**
Beautiful is better than ugly, explicit is better than implicit

**The Unix Philosophy:**
Do one thing and do it well

### What Makes Them Powerful?

- Clear values
- Specific principles
- Memorable language
- Practical application

## Your Manifesto's Power

When you have a clear manifesto:

- Decisions become obvious
- Boundaries become firm
- Purpose becomes clear
- Direction becomes certain
- Integrity becomes natural

## Final Reflection

1. **What surprised you** as you wrote this?
2. **What feels most important** in your manifesto?
3. **What will be hardest** to live up to?
4. **What excites you most** about living this way?
5. **Who do you become** if you live this fully?

## Your Commitment

Sign and date your manifesto. This is your contract with yourself.

Print it. Frame it. Live it.

## Key Takeaway

Your manifesto isn't just wordsâ€”it's your operating system. It's the code that runs your life. When everything else is uncertain, your manifesto is your constant. It's not about being perfect; it's about being intentional. Every day you either honor it or betray it. Choose wisely.

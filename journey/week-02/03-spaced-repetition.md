## Hey friend! ðŸ‘‹

Ever feel like you're constantly relearning the same stuff? Like you master
React hooks one week, then forget the syntax the next? In this lesson we're
fixing that with spaced repetition, the closest thing to a cheat code for your
memory.

## The Big Idea ðŸ’¡

**Your brain forgets 70% of new information within 24 hours. But if you review
at the right moments, you can remember it forever.**

Think of your memory like a leaky bucket. Most learning methods just pour more
water in without fixing the holes. Spaced repetition patches the holes so your
knowledge actually stays put.

## Why This Matters

**Meet Alex, a developer without spaced repetition:**

- Learns Docker commands for a project
- Uses them daily for two weeks
- Switches to frontend work
- Three months later: "What was that docker run command again?"

**Now meet Sam, who uses spaced repetition:**

- Learns the same Docker commands
- Reviews them after 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month
- Six months later: Still remembers them perfectly

The time investment? Sam spent maybe 10 extra minutes total. Alex has re-Googled
those commands dozens of times.

## Your 15-Minute Mission

### Set Up Your Spaced Repetition System (10 minutes)

**Option 1: Digital (Recommended)**

- Download Anki (free) or Remnote
- Create a deck called "Tech Learning"
- Add your first flashcard about something you're learning this week

**Option 2: Simple Journal Method**

- Create three lists: "Review in this lesson," "Review This Week," "Review This
  Month"
- Write down one thing you learned yesterday in "Review in this lesson"

### Your First Spaced Review (5 minutes)

Pick something you learned in the last few days and write it down with these
intervals:

- Review again: Tomorrow
- Review again: In 3 days
- Review again: In 1 week
- Review again: In 2 weeks

Set calendar reminders or use your chosen tool to track these reviews.

## Quick Win âœ…

Right now, create one flashcard or note about a coding concept you've had to
look up more than once. Examples:

- "How to center a div with flexbox"
- "Array.map() syntax in JavaScript"
- "Git command to undo last commit"

Schedule your first review for tomorrow!

## Real Talk ðŸ’¬

You might be thinking, "This sounds like a lot of work." But here's the thing:
you're already spending time relearning stuff. Spaced repetition just
front-loads a tiny bit of effort to save massive time later.

It's like investing 10 minutes to save 10 hours. Pretty good ROI, right?

Also, don't try to add everything to your system. Focus on the concepts you use
regularly or the ones that keep tripping you up.

## Key Takeaway

Stop letting your hard-earned knowledge slip away. A simple spaced repetition
system can turn temporary learning into permanent knowledge with just a few
minutes of daily review.

Your future self will thank you when you effortlessly remember that syntax you
learned months ago.

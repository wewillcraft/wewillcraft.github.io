# 5-Year Vision Creation

**Time:** 60 minutes
**Purpose:** Create a compelling vision that makes today's sacrifices worth it

## Why 5 Years?

- **Far enough** to dream big
- **Close enough** to feel real
- **Long enough** for transformation
- **Short enough** to maintain urgency

Five years ago, you were different. Five years from now, you'll be unrecognizable—if you design it intentionally.

Write a letter from your future self to your current self for dark moments:

"Dear [Current You],

I'm writing from 5 years in the future. I need you to know that...

## This Week's Challenge

**Live one day AS your future self:**

- Make decisions from that identity

- Work with that focus
- Treat people with that wisdom

Notice the gap. That's your growth edge.

Your 5-year vision isn't a prediction—it's a decision. Every day you either move toward it or away from it. There's no standing still. Make your vision so compelling that your daily decisions become obvious.

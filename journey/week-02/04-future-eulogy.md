# Future Eulogy Exercise

**Time:** 30 minutes
**Purpose:** Reverse-engineer your life by defining how you want to be remembered

## The Power of Reverse Engineering

As developers, we often start with the end goal and work backward. Apply the same logic to your life. By imagining your eulogy, you clarify what truly matters—not what seems urgent today.

## Setting the Scene

**Imagine:** You've lived a long, full life. You're 85+ years old. Your funeral is packed with people whose lives you've touched. Four people will speak about you.

Take a moment to really visualize this. Feel the weight of a life fully lived.

## Part 1: The Four Speakers (20 minutes)

_Someone who knew you most intimately_

**They say:**

"[Your name] was the kind of [parent/sibling/child/partner] who..."

---

---

---

"What I'll miss most is..."

---

---

"They taught me that..."

---

---

### Speaker 2: Best Friend

_Someone who knew your true self_

**They say:**

"If you really knew [Your name], you knew they..."

"[Your name]'s approach to work was..."

---

"Every junior developer they mentored learned..."

---

---

### Speaker 4: Someone You Helped

_Someone whose life you changed_

**They say:**

"I wouldn't be here today if [Your name] hadn't..."

---

---

---

"They saw in me..."

---

---

"Because of them, I..."

---

---

"I exist to **[action]** for **[who]** so that **[impact]**, and I'll know I've succeeded when **[metric/outcome]**."

## This Week's Challenge

**Live one day as if your eulogy was being written tomorrow.**

- How do you treat people?
- What work do you prioritize?
- What conversations do you have?
- What habits do you change?

Notice the gap between that day and your normal days.

## Reflection Questions

1. What surprised you most about your ideal eulogy?
2. What current priority doesn't appear in your eulogy?
3. Who would you want to speak at your funeral today?
4. What would you need to change to die with zero regrets?

## Key Takeaway

Your eulogy isn't about death—it's about life. It's the compass pointing toward what matters. Every line of code you write, every relationship you nurture, every choice you make is writing this eulogy. Make it worth reading.

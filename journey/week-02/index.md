## Hey friend! ðŸ‘‹

Last week you discovered WHO you are. This week we're diving into WHAT you care about at your deepest level. Think of it as finding your internal GPS - that inner compass that points toward what truly matters to you.

## The Big Idea ðŸ’¡

**When you're clear on what matters most, decisions become easier.**

You know that feeling when you're torn between options? That confusion usually comes from unclear values. Once you know what you truly care about, choices become obvious. You stop second-guessing yourself and start living with more confidence and purpose.

## This Week's Adventure

### Day 1: [What Do You Actually Value?](./01-values-discovery)

_Time: 15 minutes_

Not what you think you should value - what you ACTUALLY value. There's often a gap, and we're going to find it.

### Day 2: [Finding Your Sweet Spot](./02-ikigai-mapping)

_Time: 15 minutes_

Where your passions, talents, and the world's needs overlap. Spoiler: This is where magic happens.

### Day 3: [Your Story So Far](./03-life-timeline)

_Time: 20 minutes_

Looking back to understand your patterns. Your past holds clues to your future direction.

### Day 4: [How Do You Want to be Remembered?](./04-future-eulogy)

_Time: 15 minutes_

A bit intense, but incredibly clarifying. What legacy do you want to leave?

### Day 5: [Painting Your Future](./05-vision-creation)

_Time: 20 minutes_

Creating a vision that actually inspires you (not just looks good on paper).

### Day 6: [Your Tech Purpose](./06-technical-calling)

_Time: 15 minutes_

Why are you in tech? What problems do you want to solve with your skills?

### Day 7: [Writing Your Manifesto](./07-personal-manifesto)

_Time: 15 minutes_

Pulling it all together into a personal declaration. Your "this is what I stand for" statement.

## What You'll Walk Away With

By Sunday, you'll have:

- âœ… Your top 5 core values (the ones that are actually true for you)
- âœ… A clear picture of where your passions and talents align
- âœ… A vision that genuinely excites you
- âœ… Your personal manifesto - your "line in the sand"

## Real Talk ðŸ’¬

Values work can feel abstract or touchy-feely. But here's the thing - unclear values are the root of most career unhappiness. When you take a job that conflicts with what you really care about, you'll feel it every single day.

This isn't about finding the "perfect" values. It's about getting honest about what's already driving your decisions (whether you realize it or not).

## Why This Matters Right Now

In a world of infinite options, values are your filter. They help you say no to good opportunities so you can say yes to great ones. They give you a reason to get up on hard days. They connect you with like-minded people and meaningful work.

Plus, when you're clear on your values, imposter syndrome starts to fade. You're not trying to be someone else - you're being authentically you.

## Your Daily Rhythm

Each day this week:

1. **Read the lesson** (5 minutes)
2. **Do the exercise** (10-15 minutes)
3. **Write one insight** - What surprised you? What felt true?

Keep it simple. The goal is clarity, not perfection.

# Values Discovery Exercise

**Time:** 90 minutes
**Purpose:** Identify your top 5 core values that guide your decisions and define success

## Why Values Matter for Developers

Your values determine:

- **Which companies** you'll thrive at (startup vs. enterprise)
- **Which roles** will fulfill you (IC vs. management)
- **Which technologies** you'll pursue (bleeding edge vs. stable)
- **Which teams** you'll excel in (competitive vs. collaborative)
- **Which decisions** you'll make (security vs. freedom)

When your work aligns with your values, Monday mornings feel different.

### Step 2: Narrowing Down (20 minutes)

From your selected values, group them into themes. Often, multiple values point to the same core desire:

**Example groupings:**

- Learning + Growth + Curiosity = **GROWTH**
- Freedom + Autonomy + Independence = **AUTONOMY**
- Excellence + Quality + Mastery = **CRAFTSMANSHIP**

Your groupings:

1. Group 1: **\*\***\_**\*\*** = Core Value: **\*\***\_**\*\***
2. Group 2: **\*\***\_**\*\*** = Core Value: **\*\***\_**\*\***
3. Group 3: **\*\***\_**\*\*** = Core Value: **\*\***\_**\*\***
4. Group 4: **\*\***\_**\*\*** = Core Value: **\*\***\_**\*\***
5. Group 5: **\*\***\_**\*\*** = Core Value: **\*\***\_**\*\***

### Step 3: The Tournament (15 minutes)

Put your top 10 values through elimination rounds:

**Round 1:** Compare each pair, keep the winner

- Value A vs. Value B → Winner: **\_**
- Value C vs. Value D → Winner: **\_**
- Value E vs. Value F → Winner: **\_**
- Value G vs. Value H → Winner: **\_**
- Value I vs. Value J → Winner: **\_**

**Round 2:** Compare the 5 winners

- Winner 1 vs. Winner 2 → **\_**
- Winner 3 vs. Winner 4 → **\_**
- Winner 5 advances

**Final:** Your Top 5 in order

1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

### Step 4: The Sacrifice Test (10 minutes)

For each of your top 5, ask:
"Would I take a job that paid 2x but violated this value?"

If yes, it might be an aspiration, not a core value.

## Part 2: Values Definition (20 minutes)

Define what each value means TO YOU:

### Value 1: [Your #1 Value]

**What it means to me:**
[Your personal definition]

**It looks like:**

- In code: [How it shows up in your programming]
- In career: [How it guides career decisions]
- In life: [How it shows up personally]

**When it's honored, I feel:**
[Your emotions when living this value]

**When it's violated, I feel:**
[Your emotions when this value is compromised]

### Value 2-5: [Repeat the format above]

## Part 3: Values in Action (15 minutes)

### Past Evidence

For each value, identify a time when:

1. **You sacrificed something** to honor this value
2. **You felt energized** because this value was present
3. **You felt drained** because this value was missing

### Current Alignment Check

Rate your current life/work alignment with each value (1-10):

| Value | Current Alignment | Gap Analysis          |
| ----- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| 1.    | \_\_\_/10         | What needs to change? |
| 2.    | \_\_\_/10         | What needs to change? |
| 3.    | \_\_\_/10         | What needs to change? |
| 4.    | \_\_\_/10         | What needs to change? |
| 5.    | \_\_\_/10         | What needs to change? |

## Part 4: Values Conflicts (10 minutes)

### Identifying Tensions

Which of your values sometimes conflict?

**Example:** Security vs. Adventure

- Security wants: Stable job, predictable income
- Adventure wants: Startup life, new challenges

Your conflicts:

1. \***\*\_\*\*** vs. \***\*\_\*\***

   - How you'll balance them: \***\*\_\_\_\*\***

2. \***\*\_\*\*** vs. \***\*\_\*\***
   - How you'll balance them: \***\*\_\_\_\*\***

### Priority Hierarchy

When values conflict, which wins?
Create your decision tree:

```
If [Value A] conflicts with [Value B] → [Value A/B] wins
If [Value B] conflicts with [Value C] → [Value B/C] wins
If [Value A] conflicts with [Value C] → [Value A/C] wins
```

## Application to Developer Life

### Your Values-Based Career Filter

Based on your top 5 values, answer:

**Ideal Company Culture:**

- Size: [Startup/Scale-up/Enterprise]
- Style: [Competitive/Collaborative]
- Pace: [Fast-moving/Stable]

**Ideal Role Characteristics:**

- Autonomy level: [High/Medium/Low]
- Impact visibility: [Direct/Indirect]
- Learning opportunity: [Constant/Periodic]

**Deal Breakers:**

1. I could never work somewhere that: \***\*\_\_\_\*\***
2. I could never work on products that: \***\*\_\_\_\*\***
3. I could never work with people who: \***\*\_\_\_\*\***

## Your Values Statement

Combine everything into a single paragraph:

"I am a developer who values **[Value 1]** above all else, which means I **[specific behavior/choice]**. This is supported by my commitment to **[Value 2]** and **[Value 3]**, which show up in my work through **[specific examples]**. I also deeply value **[Value 4]** and **[Value 5]**, which guide me to **[specific decisions/actions]**. When these values are honored, I **[how you feel/perform]**."

## Reflection Questions

1. Which value discovery surprised you most?
2. Which value have you been ignoring lately?
3. Which value explains your biggest career decision?
4. Which value will guide your next big decision?

## This Week's Challenge

**Live by design, not default.**

For the next 7 days:

- Make ONE decision each day explicitly using your values
- Notice when values are honored or violated
- Journal the impact on your energy

## Key Takeaway

Your values aren't just words—they're your operating system. When you make decisions aligned with your values, you build a life you don't need to escape from. When you violate them, no amount of success feels satisfying.

# Life Timeline Analysis

**Time:** 45 minutes
**Purpose:** Identify patterns in your life story to understand what creates fulfillment

## Why Your Past Holds Your Future

Your life's peaks and valleys aren't random. They're data points showing when your values aligned with your reality—and when they didn't. This exercise helps you recognize patterns so you can architect more peaks and fewer valleys.

## Part 1: Timeline Creation (20 minutes)

### Draw Your Lifeline

On a piece of paper (or digitally), draw a horizontal line representing your life from birth to now.

Above the line: **Peaks** (positive experiences)
Below the line: **Valleys** (challenges/negative experiences)
Height/depth indicates intensity

### Mark Significant Events

Add these to your timeline:

**Life Events:**

- First computer/coding experience
- School transitions
- First job/internship
- Career changes
- Relationship milestones
- Achievements
- Failures/setbacks
- Moves/relocations
- Health events
- Learning breakthroughs

**Coding Journey Markers:**

- First "Hello World"
- First working program
- First bug that took days
- First deployed project
- First user
- First job offer
- First promotion/rejection
- First mentorship
- First time teaching others

### Rate Each Event

For each marked event, note:

- **Intensity:** (+5 to -5)
- **Age:** When it happened
- **Duration:** How long it lasted
- **Impact:** Still affects you? (Y/N)

## Part 2: Pattern Analysis (15 minutes)

## Part 3: Values Correlation (10 minutes)

### Values in Peaks

For each peak, identify which of your top 5 values were honored:

| Peak Event | Value 1 | Value 2 | Value 3 | Value 4 | Value 5 |
| ---------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Event 1    | ✓/✗     | ✓/✗     | ✓/✗     | ✓/✗     | ✓/✗     |
| Event 2    | ✓/✗     | ✓/✗     | ✓/✗     | ✓/✗     | ✓/✗     |
| Event 3    | ✓/✗     | ✓/✗     | ✓/✗     | ✓/✗     | ✓/✗     |

**Most honored value in peaks:** **\*\***\_**\*\***

### Values in Valleys

For each valley, identify which values were violated:

| Valley Event | Value 1 | Value 2 | Value 3 | Value 4 | Value 5 |
| ------------ | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Event 1      | ✓/✗     | ✓/✗     | ✓/✗     | ✓/✗     | ✓/✗     |
| Event 2      | ✓/✗     | ✓/✗     | ✓/✗     | ✓/✗     | ✓/✗     |
| Event 3      | ✓/✗     | ✓/✗     | ✓/✗     | ✓/✗     | ✓/✗     |

**Most violated value in valleys:** **\*\***\_**\*\***

## Future Peak Design

Based on your patterns, design your next peak:

**It will include:**

- Values honored: **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\***
- Environment: **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\***
- People: **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\***
- Type of work: **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\***
- Growth opportunity: **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\***

**I'll avoid valleys by:**

- Not ignoring: **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\***
- Setting boundaries around: **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\***
- Speaking up about: **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\***
- Asking for: **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\***

## Integration Questions

1. **What pattern surprised you most?**

2. **What valley are you most grateful for?**

3. **What peak do you want to recreate?**

4. **What story do you want your timeline to tell in 5 years?**

## Your Life Thesis

Complete this statement based on your timeline:

"My life has shown me that I thrive when **[conditions from peaks]**, and I struggle when **[conditions from valleys]**. The thread through my story is **[consistent pattern]**. Moving forward, I will seek **[what creates peaks]** and protect myself from **[what creates valleys]** by **[specific boundaries/choices]**."

## This Week's Practice

**Timeline Awareness:**

- Notice this week's mini-peaks and valleys
- Identify what creates each
- Make one adjustment based on patterns

## Key Takeaway

Your timeline isn't just history—it's a map. Every peak shows you what works. Every valley shows you what doesn't. You're not starting from zero; you're building on years of data about what makes you come alive. Use it.

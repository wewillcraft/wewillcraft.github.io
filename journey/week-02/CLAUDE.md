## Language Specific to Purpose

### Instead of:

- "Find your passion" → "Notice what energizes you"

- "Calling" → "What pulls you forward"
- "Mission statement" → "What you're about"
- "Vision board" → "Future sketch"

## Writing Style Notes

### Avoid Em Dashes

- **NO EM DASHES (—)**: They sound too AI-written
- Use shorter sentences instead
- Or use commas for quick asides
- Sometimes a colon works: like this
- Questions can break things up too. See?
- Just write like you're talking to a friend

## Sensitive Topics Approach

### Past Exploration:

- Keep it light
- No forced vulnerability
- Focus on strengths from struggles
- "Only share what's comfortable"

### Future Planning:

- Acknowledge uncertainty
- Multiple futures are okay
- Plan to plan again
- "This isn't set in stone"

## Weekly Emotional Arc

**Monday (Lesson 1-2)**: "Let's explore what matters to you"
**Wednesday (Lesson 3-4)**: "Your past has prepared you"

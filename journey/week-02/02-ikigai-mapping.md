# Ikigai Mapping

**Time:** 60 minutes
**Purpose:** Discover your "reason for being" at the intersection of passion, mission, profession, and vocation

## What is Ikigai?

Ikigai (生き甲斐) is a Japanese concept meaning "reason for being." For developers, it's finding code that:

- **Excites you** to write (Passion)
- **Leverages your strengths** (Talent)
- **Solves real problems** (Impact)
- **Pays the bills** (Sustainability)

When all four align, work doesn't feel like work.

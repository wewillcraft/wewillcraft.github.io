# Finding Your Technical Calling

**Time:** 45 minutes
**Purpose:** Identify your unique technical mission and the problems you're meant to solve

## What is a Technical Calling?

It's not just what you code—it's why you code. Your technical calling is the intersection of:

- Problems that anger you
- Solutions that excite you
- Skills that come naturally
- Impact that matters to you

When you find it, Monday mornings feel like opportunities, not obligations.

## Part 1: Problem Discovery (15 minutes)

### The Frustration Inventory

**Technical problems that make me angry:**

- [ ] Slow, inefficient systems
- [ ] Poor user experiences
- [ ] Data silos and fragmentation
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Inaccessible technology
- [ ] Repetitive manual tasks
- [ ] Broken deployment processes
- [ ] Bad documentation
- [ ] Legacy code debt
- [ ] Scalability issues

**Real-world problems I notice everywhere:**

1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

**Industries that need disruption:**

- [ ] Healthcare
- [ ] Education
- [ ] Finance
- [ ] Government
- [ ] Transportation
- [ ] Energy
- [ ] Agriculture
- [ ] Retail

---

## Part 4: The Calling Statement (10 minutes)

### Your Technical Mission

Combine everything into your calling:

"I am called to **[solve/build/create]** **[specific solution]** for **[who]** suffering from **[problem]** using **[technical approach]** because **[why this matters to you personally]**."

**Example:**
"I am called to **build accessible education platforms** for **underserved students** suffering from **lack of quality learning resources** using **AI-powered personalization** because **I believe talent is universal but opportunity isn't**."

**Your calling:**

---

---

---

### The 10-Year Technical Vision

**In 10 years, my code will have:**

- Impacted: **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\*** people
- Solved: **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\*** (problem)
- Created: **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\*** (value)
- Enabled: **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\*** (possibility)
- Changed: **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\*** (industry/field)

### Your Technical North Star

**The company/project I'd love to work on:**

---

**The team I'd love to join/build:**

---

**The mentor I'd love to learn from:**

---

**The legacy I'd love to leave:**

---

## The Path Forward

### Next 90 Days

To move toward your calling:

**Learn:**

- Technology: **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\***
- Concept: **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\***
- Tool: **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\***

**Build:**

- Project: **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\***
- Proof of concept: **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\***
- Contribution: **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\***

**Connect:**

- Community: **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\***
- Mentor: **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\***
- Peer: **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\***

### The Daily Question

"Did today's code move me closer to my calling?"

Create a daily reminder to ask this.

## Validation Exercise

### The Excitement Test

When you think about your calling:

- Do you feel energized? (Y/N)
- Could you talk about it for hours? (Y/N)
- Do you research it in your free time? (Y/N)
- Would you do it for free? (Y/N)
- Does it scare you a little? (Y/N)

If not all "Yes," refine your calling.

### The Alignment Check

Does your calling align with:

- Your values? (from earlier exercise)
- Your ikigai? (all 4 circles)
- Your personality? (from assessments)
- Your vision? (5-year plan)

Adjust until everything connects.

## Key Takeaway

Your technical calling isn't about the language you use or the framework you prefer. It's about the dent you want to make in the universe with code. When you find it, learning becomes effortless, work becomes play, and impact becomes inevitable.

## Hey friend! ðŸ‘‹

Yesterday you discovered your core values. In this lesson we're finding where
your natural interests, talents, and the world's needs all come together. This
is where career magic happens!

## The Big Idea ðŸ’¡

**Your ideal career sits at the intersection of what you love, what you're good
at, what the world needs, and what pays well.** This Japanese concept called
"ikigai" can help you find work that doesn't feel like work.

## Why This Matters

When you find your ikigai:

- Work feels energizing instead of draining
- You naturally excel because you're using your strengths
- You make a real impact on problems you care about
- You can build a sustainable career around it

## Your 15-Minute Mission

### The Four Questions (15 minutes)

Draw four overlapping circles and answer these:

**Circle 1: What do you LOVE doing?**

- What parts of coding/work make you lose track of time?
- What would you do even if you weren't paid?
- What are you curious about?

**Circle 2: What are you GOOD at?**

- What do people always ask for your help with?
- What comes naturally to you?
- What are your technical strengths?

**Circle 3: What does the world NEED?**

- What problems frustrate you in daily life?
- What would make people's lives better?
- What challenges is society facing?

**Circle 4: What can you be PAID for?**

- What skills have market value?
- What are companies hiring for?
- What would someone pay you to solve?

## Quick Win âœ…

**Right now:** Think about the last project that felt effortless and fulfilling.
What elements made it special? That's your ikigai showing up!

## Real Talk

Don't expect to find the perfect intersection immediately. Most people need to
experiment and adjust over time. The goal is direction, not perfection.

Also, you might have multiple ikigai areas throughout your life. That's totally
normal! Your sweet spot can evolve as you do.

## Common Tech Ikigai Examples

**The Problem Solver:** Loves debugging + Great at analysis + World needs fewer
bugs + Companies pay well for this

**The Teacher:** Loves explaining + Good at communication + World needs more
education + Online courses pay

**The Builder:** Loves creating + Good at execution + World needs new tools +
Startups need this

## Key Takeaway

Your ikigai isn't a destination you arrive at - it's a direction you move
toward. The closer you get to that sweet spot, the more your work will feel like
play. ðŸŽ¯

# Week 2: Meditation & Reflection

You've spent this week exploring your values, your purpose, your "why." Now
let's step back and see the bigger picture.

## Quick Reflection

- What patterns do you see in what you care about?
- Where do you feel most alive and energized?
- What would you do if you knew you couldn't fail?
- How has your past prepared you for your purpose?

## Scripture

> "For I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord, "plans to prosper
> you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future." - Jeremiah
> 29:11

> "In their hearts humans plan their course, but the Lord establishes their
> steps." - Proverbs 16:9

## The Heart of It

Here's what's beautiful about purpose: God rarely shows us the whole picture at
once.

Moses was 80 before he led Israel out of Egypt. David was anointed king but
spent years running from Saul. Joseph's path to saving nations went through
slavery and prison. None of them could see how their story would unfold. They
just took the next faithful step.

The pressure to "find your purpose" can be overwhelming. But here's the truth
that should free you: Your purpose isn't something you discover through endless
searching. It's revealed as you walk faithfully forward.

## A Simple Truth

Your calling might not be glamorous. It might be writing code that makes
someone's job easier or being the friend who always listens. The kingdom of God
is built on such "ordinary" faithfulness.

## This Week's Practice

Each evening, ask yourself:

1. Where did I act in alignment with my values in this lesson?
2. Where did I serve someone else, even in a small way?
3. Where did I see God at work?

Don't overthink it. Purpose often looks like ordinary faithfulness in daily
life.

## Prayer

"God, I wish You would just tell me clearly what I'm supposed to do with my
life. But I choose to trust that You're working even when I can't see it. Help
me be faithful with what's in front of me in this lesson. Guide my steps. I
trust You with my story. Amen."

## Looking Ahead

Next week: productivity and time management. Remember: productivity without
purpose is just busy-ness.

## Remember This

You don't have to have it all figured out. You just need to be faithful with in
this lesson. Take the next right step. Use the gifts you have, even if they seem
small.

Your purpose is unfolding. Trust the Author who's writing your story. You're
exactly where you need to be to become who you're meant to be.

Help-seeking practice:

## Language Specific to Help

### Instead of:
- "I should know this" → "I'm learning this"
- "Stupid question" → "Quick question"
- "Sorry to bother" → "Could you help"
- "I'm stuck" → "I need guidance"
- "I give up" → "Time to ask for help"

## Writing Style Notes

### Avoid Em Dashes
- **NO EM DASHES (—)**: They sound too AI-written
- Use shorter sentences instead
- Or use commas for quick asides
- Sometimes a colon works: like this
- Questions can break things up too. See?
- Just write like you're talking to a friend

## Common Help Barriers

### For Prideful:
- Everyone asks for help
- It's efficient, not weak
- You'd help others
- "Let people help you"

### For Shy/Introverted:
- Online first is fine
- Async communication works
- One-on-one is valid
- "Start where comfortable"

### For Impostor Syndrome:
- Your questions help others
- Beginners ask best questions
- Everyone was new once
- "You belong here"

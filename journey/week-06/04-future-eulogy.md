# Day 4: What They'll Say About You

Hey friend! ðŸ‘‹

## The Big Idea ðŸ’¡

What if you could peek into the future and see exactly how people remember you? In this lesson we're doing something powerful - we're writing your eulogy to understand what kind of legacy you actually want to create. It's like debugging your life from the end backward.

## Why This Matters

Here's the thing - we spend so much time putting out daily fires that we forget to ask "Am I building something worth remembering?" This isn't morbid; it's strategic. Just like good code starts with understanding the end user's needs, a good life starts with understanding how you want to be remembered.

## Your 15-20 Minute Mission

Picture this: You're 85, you've lived an incredible life, and your memorial service is packed. Four people stand to speak about you. What do they say?

### Step 1: The Family Speaker (5 minutes)

Write what a close family member would say:

- "[Your name] was the kind of person who..."
- "What I'll miss most is..."
- "They taught me that..."

### Step 2: The Best Friend (5 minutes)

Write what your closest friend would share:

- "If you really knew [Your name], you knew they..."
- "We laughed most about..."
- "Their friendship meant..."

### Step 3: The Professional Colleague (5 minutes)

Write what a work peer would remember:

- "[Your name]'s approach to work was..."
- "They changed our industry by..."
- "Every person they mentored learned..."

### Step 4: Someone You Helped (5 minutes)

Write what someone whose life you changed would say:

- "I wouldn't be here in this lesson if [Your name] hadn't..."
- "They saw in me..."
- "Because of them, I..."

## Quick Win âœ…

Right now, write one sentence: "I want to be remembered as someone who..."

Don't overthink it. Just finish that sentence with the first thing that comes to mind.

## Real Talk ðŸ’¬

This exercise might feel heavy, but here's the beautiful truth: you get to choose what story gets told. Every day, every decision, every relationship is writing your eulogy. The gap between your ideal eulogy and your current reality? That's not judgment - that's your roadmap.

Don't aim for perfection. Aim for intentionality. Small changes in how you treat people, what work you prioritize, and where you invest your time can completely change your legacy.

## Key Takeaway

Your eulogy isn't about death - it's about life. It's your north star showing you what actually matters, not just what feels urgent.

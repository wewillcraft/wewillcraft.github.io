# Building in Public

## Introduction

Building in public is the practice of sharing your learning journey, projects, and professional development openly with the developer community. This transparency creates opportunities for help, mentorship, collaboration, and career advancement that wouldn't exist if you worked in isolation. However, many developers hesitate to share their work publicly due to imposter syndrome, fear of criticism, or uncertainty about what to share and how.

This lesson transforms building in public from a scary vulnerability into a strategic career development tool. You'll learn to share your learning process, showcase your projects, and engage with the community in ways that attract help naturally and build your professional reputation. The goal is to become known for your learning mindset and growing expertise rather than hiding until you feel "ready."

Building in public leverages the community's desire to help and connect, turning your learning journey into a networking and professional development accelerator.

## Hey friend! üëã

In this lesson we're going on a little trip down memory lane. Not to get stuck
in the past, but to find the gold hidden in your story. Because here's the
thing: your life has been teaching you what works for you all along. We just
need to connect the dots.

## The Big Idea üí°

**Your peaks and valleys aren't random. They're clues to what makes you come
alive.**

Think of your life like a video game where you've been collecting data points.
Every high moment shows you what to pursue. Every low moment shows you what to
avoid. in this lesson, we decode that data.

## Why This Matters

Ever notice how some people thrive in chaos while others need calm? Or how some
love working alone while others need a team? That's not random. Your past
experiences have been teaching you YOUR formula for happiness and success. Let's
find it.

## Your 20-Minute Mission

### Part 1: Draw Your Lifeline (10 minutes)

Grab a piece of paper (or use your phone's drawing app). Draw a simple line
across the page. This is your life from birth to now.

**Above the line**: Mark your peaks (the good times) **Below the line**: Mark
your valleys (the tough times) **How high/low**: Shows how intense it felt

Include things like:

- First time you felt really proud
- When you discovered something you loved
- Your biggest win
- Your toughest challenge
- Major transitions (school, jobs, moves)
- Relationship highs and lows
- That time everything just clicked

Don't overthink it! Just mark what comes to mind first.

### Part 2: Find the Pattern (7 minutes)

Look at your peaks. Ask yourself:

- What did they have in common?
- Were you learning something new?
- Were you helping others?
- Did you have freedom to create?
- Were you part of something bigger?

Now look at your valleys:

- What was missing?
- Were you isolated?
- Did you lack purpose?
- Were your values being stepped on?
- Were you trying to be someone you're not?

### Part 3: Connect to in this lesson (3 minutes)

Write down:

1. **My peaks usually happen when I have:** ____________
2. **My valleys usually happen when I lack:** ____________
3. **The pattern I see is:** ____________

## Quick Win ‚úÖ

**Right now, in 2 minutes:**

Think about your current situation. Is it more peak or valley? Based on your
pattern, what's ONE small thing you could add or remove to move it more toward
peak territory?

Write it down and do it this week.

## Real Talk üí¨

Looking at your valleys might bring up some feelings. That's okay. Those tough
times? They weren't failures. They were teachers. Every valley taught you
something about what you need to thrive.

And here's what's beautiful: You survived every single valley. You're here,
reading this, ready to grow. That's not small. That's warrior stuff right there.

Your peaks? They're not just nice memories. They're your blueprint. They show
you exactly what conditions you need to create more of those moments.

## The Developer's Angle üñ•Ô∏è

If you work in tech, also notice:

- When did coding feel like play vs. work?
- What projects made you lose track of time?
- When did you feel most proud of your work?
- What environments helped you do your best work?

These aren't just preferences. They're requirements for your best work.

## Going Deeper (Optional)

If you want to explore more:

- Rate each event from -5 to +5 for intensity
- Note which of your core values were present in peaks
- Identify which values were violated in valleys
- Look for the transition triggers (what helped you climb out of valleys?)

## Your Story Continues...

Remember: Your timeline isn't finished. You're literally writing the next
chapter right now. And now that you can see the pattern, you can write a better
story.

What if your next peak could be your highest one yet? What if you now know
exactly what ingredients you need to create it?

## Key Takeaway

Your life has been teaching you what works for YOU all along. The peaks show you
what to pursue. The valleys show you what to avoid. Now you have the map.

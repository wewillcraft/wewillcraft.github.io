# Day 6: Your Code, Your Calling

Hey friend! ðŸ‘‹

## The Big Idea ðŸ’¡

There's a reason you were drawn to programming. Maybe it was the power to
create, the thrill of solving puzzles, or the desire to make life better for
people. In this lesson we're uncovering your unique technical calling - the
specific problems you're meant to solve with code.

## Why This Matters

You know that feeling when you're working on something that just clicks? Where
time disappears and you feel totally in your element? That's not random - that's
your calling calling. When you find the intersection of problems that frustrate
you and solutions that excite you, Monday mornings start feeling like
opportunities, not obligations.

## Your 15-20 Minute Mission

### Step 1: What Breaks Your Heart? (5 minutes)

Think about the last time you used an app, website, or system and thought "This
is terrible!"

- What specific problems make you want to fix them?
- What industries or areas of life feel broken to you?
- If you had unlimited resources, what ONE problem would you solve?

### Step 2: What Lights You Up? (5 minutes)

- What type of coding challenges get you excited to dive in?
- Do you love building user interfaces? Backend systems? Data pipelines? Mobile
  apps?
- Are you drawn to helping businesses be more efficient? Making life easier for
  regular people? Solving complex technical puzzles?

### Step 3: Your Developer Superpower (5 minutes)

What comes naturally to you as a developer?

- Are you the person who can explain complex things simply?
- Do you spot bugs that others miss?
- Can you see the big picture when others get lost in details?
- Are you great at making ugly code beautiful?

### Step 4: Your Calling Statement (5 minutes)

Complete this: "I am called to build [WHAT] for [WHO] because [WHY this matters
to YOU]."

## Quick Win âœ…

Right now, complete this sentence: "The world would be a better place if I could
use my coding skills to..."

Don't overthink it. Just write the first thing that comes to mind.

## Real Talk ðŸ’¬

Here's what I've noticed about developers who love their work: they've found the
sweet spot where their skills meet problems they actually care about. You might
not have all the technical chops yet, but if you're working on something that
matters to you, you'll develop them faster than you ever thought possible.

Your calling might evolve. That's totally normal. The goal isn't to get it
perfect; it's to get clear on what direction to start walking.

## Key Takeaway

Your technical calling isn't about the language you use - it's about the dent
you want to make in the universe with code.

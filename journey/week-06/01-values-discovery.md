## Hey friend! ðŸ‘‹

Ever find yourself stuck between two good options, not knowing which to choose?
In this lesson we're going to fix that by discovering what you truly value deep
down (which might surprise you!).

## The Big Idea ðŸ’¡

**Your values are your decision-making shortcut.** When you're clear on what
matters most to you, choices become obvious. No more endless pros and cons
lists!

## Why This Matters

When you know your values:

- Job searches become clearer (you know what to look for)
- Career decisions feel less scary
- You stop trying to please everyone
- You understand why certain things bug you so much

## Your 15-Minute Mission

### Step 1: Quick Values Check (10 minutes)

Look at this list and circle the words that make you think "YES, that's
important to me":

**Achievement, Adventure, Beauty, Balance, Challenge, Community, Connection,
Creativity, Excellence, Family, Freedom, Growth, Helping Others, Impact,
Independence, Innovation, Integrity, Learning, Love, Mastery, Peace,
Recognition, Security, Stability, Variety**

Don't overthink it - go with your gut reaction.

### Step 2: The Hard Choices (5 minutes)

From your circled words, pick your top 5. If you had to choose between them,
which ones would you never give up?

## Quick Win âœ…

**Right now:** Think about the last time you felt really frustrated or angry.
What value of yours was being violated? That's one of your core values showing
up!

## Real Talk

I used to think I valued "security" because that's what seemed responsible. But
when I looked at my actual choices, I always picked the risky, creative option.
My real value was "adventure," not security.

Don't choose values that sound good - choose the ones that are actually true for
you.

## Common Value Conflicts in Tech

**Security vs. Adventure:** Stable job vs. startup risk **Excellence vs.
Speed:** Perfect code vs. shipping fast\
**Independence vs. Community:** Solo work vs. team collaboration **Innovation
vs. Stability:** Latest tech vs. proven solutions

There's no right answer - just YOUR answer.

## What Your Values Mean

**If you chose Freedom:** You need autonomy and flexibility **If you chose
Learning:** You thrive with new challenges and growth **If you chose Impact:**
You want to make a meaningful difference **If you chose Excellence:** Quality
matters more than speed **If you chose Connection:** Relationships energize you

## Key Takeaway

Your values aren't suggestions - they're requirements. When you honor them, life
flows. When you ignore them, everything feels harder than it should. ðŸŽ¯

```

### Step 2: Narrowing Down (20 minutes)

From your selected values, group them into themes. Often, multiple values point
to the same core desire:

**Example groupings:**

- Learning + Growth + Curiosity = **GROWTH**
- Freedom + Autonomy + Independence = **AUTONOMY**
- Excellence + Quality + Mastery = **CRAFTSMANSHIP**

Your groupings:

1. Group 1: **\*\***\_**\*\*** = Core Value: **\*\***\_**\*\***
2. Group 2: **\*\***\_**\*\*** = Core Value: **\*\***\_**\*\***
3. Group 3: **\*\***\_**\*\*** = Core Value: **\*\***\_**\*\***
4. Group 4: **\*\***\_**\*\*** = Core Value: **\*\***\_**\*\***
5. Group 5: **\*\***\_**\*\*** = Core Value: **\*\***\_**\*\***

### Step 3: The Tournament (15 minutes)

Put your top 10 values through elimination rounds:

**Round 1:** Compare each pair, keep the winner

- Value A vs. Value B â†’ Winner: **\_**
- Value C vs. Value D â†’ Winner: **\_**
- Value E vs. Value F â†’ Winner: **\_**
- Value G vs. Value H â†’ Winner: **\_**
- Value I vs. Value J â†’ Winner: **\_**

**Round 2:** Compare the 5 winners

- Winner 1 vs. Winner 2 â†’ **\_**
- Winner 3 vs. Winner 4 â†’ **\_**
- Winner 5 advances

**Final:** Your Top 5 in order

1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

### Step 4: The Sacrifice Test (10 minutes)

For each of your top 5, ask: "Would I take a job that paid 2x but violated this
value?"

If yes, it might be an aspiration, not a core value.

## Part 2: Values Definition (20 minutes)

Define what each value means TO YOU:

### Value 1: [Your #1 Value]

**What it means to me:** [Your personal definition]

**It looks like:**

- In code: [How it shows up in your programming]
- In career: [How it guides career decisions]
- In life: [How it shows up personally]

**When it's honored, I feel:** [Your emotions when living this value]

**When it's violated, I feel:** [Your emotions when this value is compromised]

### Value 2-5: [Repeat the format above]

## Part 3: Values in Action (15 minutes)

### Past Evidence

For each value, identify a time when:

1. **You sacrificed something** to honor this value
2. **You felt energized** because this value was present
3. **You felt drained** because this value was missing

### Current Alignment Check

Rate your current life/work alignment with each value (1-10):

| Value | Current Alignment | Gap Analysis          |
| ----- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| 1.    | \_\_\_/10         | What needs to change? |
| 2.    | \_\_\_/10         | What needs to change? |
| 3.    | \_\_\_/10         | What needs to change? |
| 4.    | \_\_\_/10         | What needs to change? |
| 5.    | \_\_\_/10         | What needs to change? |

## Part 4: Values Conflicts (10 minutes)

### Identifying Tensions

Which of your values sometimes conflict?

**Example:** Security vs. Adventure

- Security wants: Stable job, predictable income
- Adventure wants: Startup life, new challenges

Your conflicts:

1. \***\*\_\*\*** vs. \***\*\_\*\***

   - How you'll balance them: \***\*\_\_\_\*\***

2. \***\*\_\*\*** vs. \***\*\_\*\***
   - How you'll balance them: \***\*\_\_\_\*\***

### Priority Hierarchy

When values conflict, which wins? Create your decision tree:

```
If [Value A] conflicts with [Value B] â†’ [Value A/B] wins
If [Value B] conflicts with [Value C] â†’ [Value B/C] wins
If [Value A] conflicts with [Value C] â†’ [Value A/C] wins
```

## Application to Developer Life

### Your Values-Based Career Filter

Based on your top 5 values, answer:

**Ideal Company Culture:**

- Size: [Startup/Scale-up/Enterprise]
- Style: [Competitive/Collaborative]
- Pace: [Fast-moving/Stable]

**Ideal Role Characteristics:**

- Autonomy level: [High/Medium/Low]
- Impact visibility: [Direct/Indirect]
- Learning opportunity: [Constant/Periodic]

**Deal Breakers:**

1. I could never work somewhere that: \***\*\_\_\_\*\***
2. I could never work on products that: \***\*\_\_\_\*\***
3. I could never work with people who: \***\*\_\_\_\*\***

## Your Values Statement

Combine everything into a single paragraph:

"I am a developer who values **[Value 1]** above all else, which means I
**[specific behavior/choice]**. This is supported by my commitment to **[Value
2]** and **[Value 3]**, which show up in my work through **[specific
examples]**. I also deeply value **[Value 4]** and **[Value 5]**, which guide me
to **[specific decisions/actions]**. When these values are honored, I **[how you
feel/perform]**."

## Reflection Questions

1. Which value discovery surprised you most?
2. Which value have you been ignoring lately?
3. Which value explains your biggest career decision?
4. Which value will guide your next big decision?

## This Week's Challenge

**Live by design, not default.**

For the next 7 days:

- Make ONE decision each day explicitly using your values
- Notice when values are honored or violated
- Journal the impact on your energy

## Key Takeaway

Your values aren't just words. They're your operating system. When you make
decisions aligned with your values, you build a life you don't need to escape
from. When you violate them, no amount of success feels satisfying.

# Week 6: Meditation & Reflection

_A quick reflection on getting help and building community._

## This Week's Truth

You explored asking for help, finding mentors, and building community. Here's the beautiful truth: **God designed us to need each other.** This isn't weakness. It's how love works in the world.

## Scripture to Ponder

> "Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: If either of them falls down, one can help the other up." - Ecclesiastes 4:9-10

> "Carry each other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ." - Galatians 6:2

## Quick Reflection Questions

Take 2 minutes to think about:

1. **What makes it hard for you to ask for help?** Pride? Fear of being judged? Not wanting to bother people?

2. **When has someone's help made a real difference in your life?** How did it feel to receive that support?

3. **Who might God be trying to help you through right now?** Sometimes we pray for help while ignoring the people God sends.

## The Heart Behind It

God Himself exists in community (Father, Son, Holy Spirit). Even God doesn't operate in isolation. When we try to do everything ourselves, we're working against how creation is designed.

Remember: **Your need for help isn't a burden. It's often a gift to others.** Think about how good it feels when someone asks for your help in something you're good at. That's how others feel when you ask them.

## This Week's Practice

**The Gratitude Note** (3 minutes)

Think of one person who helped you this week. Send them a quick message: "Thanks for helping me with ___. It made a difference."

That's it. Simple gratitude for real help.

## A Short Prayer

"God, thank You for designing me to need other people. Help me overcome my pride and fear about asking for help. Show me who You've placed in my path to help me, and who I can help too. Teach me to live in the beautiful interdependence You intended. Amen."

## Looking Ahead

Next week is about sustainability. Remember: sustainable work requires knowing when to ask for help _before_ you're overwhelmed.

## Remember This

You weren't designed to do life alone. Asking for help isn't failure. It's wisdom.

Two really are better than one.

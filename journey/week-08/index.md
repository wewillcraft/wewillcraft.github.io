## Boundary Communication Scripts

**For Time Boundaries:**

- "I check email twice daily at 10 AM and 3 PM"
- "I don't work weekends except for true emergencies"

**For Energy Boundaries:**

- "I need 15 minutes between meetings to transition"
- "I work best with deep focus blocks in the morning"
- "I prefer written communication for complex topics"

**For Professional Boundaries:**

- "That's outside my area of expertise, but I can recommend..."
- "I'm at capacity for new projects until next month"
- "Let's schedule a proper meeting to discuss this thoroughly"

## The Boundary Paradox

**Counterintuitive Truth:** The clearer your boundaries, the better your relationships become.

People respect those who respect themselves. Clear boundaries:

- Reduce anxiety and resentment

- Improve communication quality
- Create space for authentic connection
- Enable sustainable giving and receiving

# Energy Boundaries

Hey friend! ðŸ‘‹

## The Big Idea ðŸ’¡

Your energy is your most valuable resource. Unlike time, which flows at a constant rate, energy fluctuates based on how you invest it. Energy boundaries are protective barriers that ensure your mental, emotional, and physical energy is directed toward what matters most, rather than scattered across endless demands.

## Why This Matters

Many professionals operate as if energy is infinite, saying yes to every request and allowing their attention to be pulled in countless directions. This inevitably leads to exhaustion, decreased performance, and burnout. Strategic energy boundary setting helps you become intentional about where you invest your finite energy resources.

## Your 15-20 Minute Mission

### Energy Audit (5 min)

**Track your energy for one day:**

- Rate energy levels hourly (1-10 scale)
- Note activities that preceded energy changes
- Identify what drains vs. energizes you

**Common Energy Drains:**

- Unnecessary meetings without clear outcomes
- Constant interruptions fragmenting attention
- Toxic relationships requiring emotional management
- Perfectionism driving diminishing returns
- Saying yes when you want to say no

**Potential Energy Sources:**

- Meaningful work aligned with strengths
- Deep focus periods producing flow states
- Positive relationships providing mutual support
- Physical movement and creative expression
- Learning and growth that creates excitement

### Create Your Energy Budget (10 min)

**Priority-Based Energy Investment:**

1. List your top 3-5 professional priorities
2. Assign energy percentage to each priority
3. Reserve 20% energy for unexpected demands
4. Build in recovery and restoration time
5. Protect energy for personal priorities

**Energy ROI Analysis:**

- Calculate energy cost vs. value created
- Identify high-leverage activities worth energy investment
- Recognize low-return activities to minimize
- Find ways to increase energy efficiency

### Energy Protection Strategies (5 min)

**Communication Energy Boundaries:**

- Batch email and message checking (3x daily max)
- Set response time expectations ("I respond within 24 hours")
- Use auto-responses during focus time
- Decline meetings without clear purpose

**Attention Energy Boundaries:**

- Create distraction-free work zones
- Protect 2-4 hour deep work blocks daily
- Use focus tools and website blockers
- Establish "closed door" policies

**Emotional Energy Boundaries:**

- Limit exposure to energy vampires
- Set limits on emotional labor
- Create buffers after draining interactions
- Practice emotional detachment when needed

## Quick Win âœ…

Choose one energy boundary to implement this week:

**Options:**

1. **Batched Communication**: Check email only at 9 AM, 1 PM, and 4 PM
2. **Meeting Buffer**: Schedule 10-minute breaks between all meetings
3. **Energy Vampire Limit**: Limit draining conversations to 15 minutes max
4. **Deep Work Protection**: Block 2 hours daily for focused work, no interruptions

Set up the systems (calendar blocks, notifications off, etc.) to make this automatic.

## Real Talk ðŸ’¬

Energy management isn't selfishâ€”it's strategic. When you protect your energy, you show up better for everything that matters. You'll initially feel guilty saying no to energy drains, but remember: every yes to something unimportant is a no to something that could be meaningful.

Some people will push back on your energy boundaries. That's usually because they benefited from your lack of boundaries. Stay firm. Your energy belongs to you, and you get to choose how to invest it.

Start small. Pick one energy boundary and practice it consistently for a week before adding another.

## Key Takeaway

Energy boundaries aren't about being rigidâ€”they're about being intentional. When you protect your energy like the finite resource it is, you create space for your best work and most meaningful relationships to flourish.

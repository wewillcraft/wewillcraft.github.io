Mentoring is not about finding someone to give you answers—it's about building relationships that help you ask better questions and see new possibilities. The best mentoring relationships are reciprocal, where both parties learn and grow. As you advance in your career and life, your responsibility shifts from being primarily a mentee to being primarily a mentor, but the learning never stops. Remember: you don't need permission to be a mentor, and you don't need to be perfect to provide value to others.

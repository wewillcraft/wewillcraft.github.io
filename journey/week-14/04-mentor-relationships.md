# Finding Your People

*Here's something cool: you've been in a mentoring relationship for 14 weeks. Whether you realized it or not, this program has been mentoring you, and you've probably been mentoring classmates along the way.*

Let's talk about something that sounds scary but is actually happening all around you: mentoring.

Here's the truth: mentoring doesn't have to be this formal, intimidating thing. The best mentoring relationships grow naturally from genuine connections and curiosity.

## Why Mentoring Matters (But Not How You Think)

Forget the image of the wise old executive taking the young professional under their wing. Real mentoring happens everywhere:

- Your coworker who's really good at writing code reviews
- The person in your Discord who always gives thoughtful feedback
- Your friend who's great at explaining complex concepts
- That senior developer who actually answers questions on Stack Overflow

And here's the secret: you're already qualified to mentor someone too.

## Remember This

Mentoring isn't about finding a wise guru to give you all the answers. It's about building genuine relationships with people who help you think better and see new possibilities.

The best part? You're already qualified to help someone. You don't need 10 years of experience or a perfect track record. You just need to care about someone's growth and be willing to share what you've learned.

Peer mentoring counts. Helping someone one step behind you counts. Answering questions in community forums counts.

You've spent 14 weeks learning and growing. That journey has given you something valuable to share.

Start somewhere. Help someone. Let people help you. Build relationships.

You've got this.

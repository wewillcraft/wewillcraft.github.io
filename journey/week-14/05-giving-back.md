# Giving Back

**Time:** 90 minutes  
**Purpose:** Design sustainable strategy for contributing to others and creating positive impact

## Success Without Significance Is the Ultimate Failure

True fulfillment comes not from what you achieve, but from what you contribute. Giving back isn't something you do after you "make it"—it's how you make your journey meaningful. When you help others grow, solve problems, or create value, you multiply your impact far beyond what any individual achievement could deliver.

But giving back isn't just about helping others; it's about becoming the person you want to be and creating the world you want to live in. Start where you are, with what you have, and give what you can. The impact will compound in ways you can't imagine, creating ripples of positive change that extend far beyond what you can see.

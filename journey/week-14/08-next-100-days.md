# Your Next Chapter

_Here's the thing: finishing these 14 weeks isn't the end of your story. It's
the end of Chapter 1._

_You've proven you can grow, you can change, you can become someone new. Now the
question is: what's your Chapter 2 going to look like?_

The next 100 days are crucial. This is where the rubber meets the road. This is
where you either build on what you've created, or you let it slowly fade away.

But here's what I know about you: you didn't come this far to come this far.
You're going to keep going.

## Why the Next 100 Days Matter

being. You've built the foundation over 14 weeks. Now you get to build the
house.

This isn't about perfection. It's about consistency. It's about showing up for
yourself every day, even when the excitement wears off.

You've got this.

only become truly yours through sustained practice. The next 100 days are your
chance to prove to yourself that this transformation is real, lasting, and just
the beginning.

You're not just trying to maintain what you've achieved. You're using it as a
launching pad for what comes next.

Look, I know it might feel scary to continue without a structured program. But
here's what I know about you: you've already proven you can do this. You showed
up for 14 weeks. You grew. You changed. You became someone new.

That person who started Week 1? They would be so proud of who you are now.

The person you are now is capable of the next 100 days.

And the person you'll be in 100 days? They'll be ready for whatever comes after
that.

Your growth never ends. It just gets more intentional, more joyful, and more
impactful.

The person you've become is now responsible for the person you're becoming.

Make them proud.

You've got this. You've always had this. Now go show the world what you can do.

This is your next chapter. Make it amazing.

      title: Create With Purpose
      description: We build what matters. Tools that empower, systems that uplift, code that serves people not just products. We believe technology should advance the greater good, serving missions that matter and people who make a difference. Every build begins with purpose and ends with impact.

      title: Reach the Unreached
      description: We find the hidden talent in unexpected places. The kid in the province with no internet. The young woman told tech isn't for her. The student who thinks change-makers look nothing like them. We go where others don't, teach who others won't, and prove that builders come from everywhere. Every untapped potential is a future legend waiting.

      title: Always Be Crafting
      description: We were made to make, even when no one's watching. Whether in small bugfixes or massive projects, we stay curious, learning, building, experimenting. We don't wait for the perfect moment or ideal conditions. We build because it's woven into who we are. Every small act of creation carries the potential to serve, shape, and spark something greater.

      description: Build bridges between youth and mentors, clubs and communities, problems and solvers. We're the glue that connects student organizations across schools, cities, and countries. Every connection multiplies possibility. Where computer science students meet healthcare NGOs, innovation happens. The network effect is our superpower.

      description: We keep the fire burning bright by constantly feeding it. Every person we teach adds fuel. Every skill we share makes it stronger. We're not passing off responsibility; we're multiplying the light. Like keepers of an eternal flame, we ensure it never dies, only grows. When you teach one, they teach ten. This is how movements spread.

      description: Never settle. What worked yesterday might not work tomorrow. We adapt, experiment, iterate. Every failure teaches, every success gets improved. We're not building a monument; we're growing a living movement that evolves with the needs it serves. Stay curious, stay humble, stay hungry.

      description: Your strength covers my weakness. My experience guides your growth. We're not just a team; we're an ecosystem where everyone's success feeds everyone else's. Code reviews, pair programming, midnight debugging sessions. We show up for each other because that's how excellence happens. When one struggles, we all lean in. When one succeeds, we all celebrate.

  items:
    - title: Activate Every Young Person
      subtitle: Awakening Youth to Their World-Changing Potential
      description: Imagine every young person in every school discovering they can be a changemaker. We make it happen through massive activation campaigns, free workshops, and purpose-discovery challenges that reach thousands. We show youth, especially in developing nations, that poverty isn't destiny, that their ideas matter, and that technology is their tool for transformation. No more waiting for someone else to fix things. No more hopelessness. Just activated young people ready to build solutions with their own hands.
    - title: Equip for Impact
      subtitle: Everything Young People Need to Change Their World
      description: We provide the complete toolkit for youth-led transformation. Open-source frameworks for running clubs, step-by-step guides for launching movements, technical training that actually matters, and leadership development that shapes character. Every resource is free, shareable, and designed to multiply. We're not gatekeepers; we're door-openers. Whether it's young people in Manila starting their first tech club or a team in Kenya building apps for local NGOs, we make sure they have everything they need to succeed.
    - title: Connect the Changemakers
      subtitle: A Global Network Where Every Young Person Wins
      description: "We're connecting the dots between youth with skills and communities with needs, between young leaders and experienced mentors, between local clubs and global movements. Our directory links every youth organization, every willing mentor, every NGO needing help. We facilitate partnerships that change trajectories: where young programmers build systems for healthcare workers, where young entrepreneurs help social enterprises scale, where everyone's victory becomes everyone's victory. This is bigger than networking; it's building the nervous system of a global movement."
    - title: Multiply the Movement
      subtitle: From One Spark to Global Fire
      description: True movements multiply themselves. We train young people not just to succeed but to replicate success, showing them how to start new clubs, mentor new leaders, and spread the movement to new territories. Our leadership accelerator creates trainers who create trainers. Our framework helps one activated club become ten, ten become a hundred. We're building a self-sustaining, ever-growing movement that will reach every school, every young person, every nation. Because when youth unite around purpose, equipped with skills, and connected to each other, impossible dreams get built.

  title: ü§∫ The 100-Day Journey
  subtitle: A 100-day transformative journey through self-discovery, skill-building, and purpose-finding. Not just a coding bootcamp, this is whole-person development for emerging changemakers.
  faqs:
    - question: What is the 100-Day Journey?
      answer: "It's a 100-day mentorship program divided into 3 phases: Foundation (self-discovery and learning), Systems (building sustainable practices), and Impact (leadership and giving back). Spread across 14 weeks with 8 practical lessons per week, covering technical skills, personal development, and optional spiritual formation."
    - question: Who can apply?
      answer: Anyone! College students, career switchers, self-taught developers, or complete beginners. You don't need coding experience, just curiosity, commitment, and a desire to grow. We especially welcome those from underrepresented backgrounds in tech.
    - question: What's the time commitment?
      answer: There's no minimum and there's no maximum. The more you put in, the more you transform. We've seen people change their lives with 30 minutes a day. We've seen others go all-in and emerge completely different. The program flexes around your life, but your results match your effort.
    - question: What will I actually learn?
      answer: You'll discover how to turn your ideas into action. Week 1-5 awakens your purpose and builds foundational skills. Week 6-10 develops systems for sustainable impact. Week 11-14 transforms you into a leader who multiplies change. Technical skills are just the beginning. You're learning to solve problems that matter, lead movements that transform, and build solutions that last.
    - question: Do I need to know how to code already?
      answer: No! The 100-Day Journey is designed for all backgrounds. We'll teach you practical web development skills, but more importantly, we'll help you learn HOW to learn, think like a developer, and build with purpose.
    - question: What makes this different from other bootcamps?
      answer: We're not building coders, we're activating changemakers. You'll work on real projects that serve real needs, receive mentorship from those who've walked this path, and join a global movement of young people transforming their communities. This isn't about getting a job. It's about discovering your calling and gaining the skills to fulfill it.
    - question: Is this a paid program?
      answer: No, this is completely free because we believe every young person deserves to discover their purpose. We're a movement, not a business. Your only payment is paying it forward. Some graduates find opportunities through our network, but our real success is when you go out and change your world.
    - question: Is this religious? Do I need to be a Christian?
      answer: While faith is our foundation, people of all beliefs (or none) are welcome! Each week includes an optional devotional lesson. Some mentors may share their faith perspective, but there's no pressure to believe or convert. We ask only for mutual respect.
    - question: What about impostor syndrome? I don't feel qualified.
      answer: "Perfect! You're exactly who we're looking for! Everyone feels unqualified at first. If you're worried you're not good enough, that just means you care. Apply anyway. Let us decide if you're ready (spoiler: you probably are)."
    - question: Can I do this while working or studying full-time?
      answer: Yes! The program is designed for busy people. Lessons are bite-sized (20-30 minutes), available 24/7, and can be completed on your schedule. Many participants balance their 100-Day Journey with work, school, or family commitments.
    - question: What kind of projects will I work on?
      answer: Real projects for real nonprofits! Past apprentices have built donation platforms, volunteer management systems, educational websites, and community tools. Your code will actually help organizations doing good in the world.
    - question: Will I get a certificate or credential?
      answer: While we don't offer formal certificates, you'll graduate with a portfolio of real projects, documented skills, mentor recommendations, and most importantly, confidence in your abilities and clarity about your path forward.
    - question: What support will I receive?
      answer: One-on-one mentorship, peer community through your cohort, access to our alumni network, code reviews, career guidance, and emotional support when things get tough (because they will, and that's okay).
    - question: What happens after the 100 days?
      answer: Graduates often become mentors for future cohorts, contribute to our open-source projects, get hired through our network, or launch their own initiatives. The 100-Day Journey is just the beginning. You'll be part of our community for life.
    - question: How competitive is admission?
      answer: We care more about attitude than aptitude. We look for curiosity, commitment, kindness, and alignment with our mission. Technical skill matters less than willingness to learn and help others.
    - question: When does the next cohort start?
      answer: We run cohorts quarterly, with applications opening 6 weeks before each start date. Check our website or join our mailing list for announcements. Can't wait? Reach out anyway! We sometimes have special arrangements.
    - question: What if I need to pause or drop out?
      answer: Life happens! If you need to pause, we'll work with you to rejoin a future cohort. If you need to leave entirely, no hard feelings. You're always welcome back when you're ready.
    - question: Do you offer scholarships or financial aid?
      answer: The program is already free! If you need help with internet access, equipment, or other barriers to participation, let us know. We have sponsors who specifically support removing obstacles for motivated learners.

Everyone was a beginner at some point. If you're unsure about anything, just ask
‚Äì we're here to help, not to judge. The worst that can happen is we'll politely
guide you to make your contribution even better.

- `docs:` - Documentation only
- `style:` - Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- `refactor:` - Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test:` - Adding missing tests
- `chore:` - Maintain

**Examples:**

```

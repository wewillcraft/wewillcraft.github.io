## Brand Essence

### The Golden Circle (Simon Sinek Framework)

#### WHY (Our Purpose)

We believe that technology should serve humanity's highest calling. We exist
because we've seen how the right tools in the right hands can multiply good in
the world. Every line of code we write, every developer we mentor, every project
we complete is an act of faith that software can be a force for justice, mercy,
and restoration.

**In one sentence:** We build because we believe our craft can light up the
darkness and lift others higher.

#### HOW (Our Process)

We create meaningful change through:

- **Purposeful Partnership**: Working alongside nonprofits, churches, and
  community organizations who are on the frontlines of change
- **Intentional Mentorship**: Walking with the next generation, passing on not
  just skills but values and vision
- **Open Collaboration**: Sharing our tools and knowledge freely so no one
  starts from scratch
- **Faithful Craftsmanship**: Building with excellence because the missions we
  serve deserve our best

#### WHAT (Our Actions)

- Build custom software for organizations doing good
- Mentor aspiring developers through the 100-Day Journey
- Connect and strengthen tech communities
- Create and maintain open-source tools for the greater good

### Our Programs

#### The 100-Day Journey

**For:** Aspiring developers from all backgrounds **Purpose:** Whole-person
development through self-discovery, skill-building, and purpose-finding
**Message:** "Not just a coding bootcamp, this is transformation from the inside
out."

#### We Will Craft (Workshops)

**For:** Tech communities, student organizations, and professionals **Purpose:**
Hands-on workshops that build skills and community together **Message:** "Learn
by doing, grow by sharing. These workshops aren't lectures; they're experiences
where we craft together." **Social Media:** @wewillcraft

#### You Will Craft (Leadership Track)

**For:** Emerging mentors and tech leaders **Purpose:** Training the trainers -
equipping those who will guide the next generation **Message:** "From learning
to leading. This is where students become teachers, where developers become
mentors, where individuals become leaders who multiply impact."

### Program Naming Philosophy

Our program names follow an intentional progression:

- **We Will Craft**: Community learning together (plural, inclusive)
- **You Will Craft**: Personal empowerment and leadership (individual growth)
- **Will Craft Software**: The collective identity we all contribute to

This naming creates a journey: We learn together → You lead others → Together we
are Will Craft

belief: our coding skills are meant to serve something greater than ourselves.
That's why we partner with nonprofits and churches to build the tech they need
to multiply their impact. But we don't stop there. We also mentor the next
generation of developers because we believe the future needs builders who code
with conscience. Every project we take on, every student we teach, is part of
our mission to prove that software can be a force for good."
